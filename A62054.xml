            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ch is the excellency of the Soul of Man, that the very Heathen, whoſe Souls were almoſt wholly immerst in greaſe and ſenſuality, and ſerv'd but as Salt, to preſerve their Bodies for a time from putrefaction (according to the Opinion of one of the most ingenious
<pb facs="tcp:64652:3"/> among them) have acknowledged it a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Plant, a drop of the Ocean of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, a Ray of a Deity;</hi> and the Body but the Caſe or Cabinet of this Jewel. The dim Ruſh-light of Nature hath enabled ſome of them to diſcern the ſpirituality, quick, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, ſelf-reflective motions, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of (their ſpecifical forms as they called) their Souls, and thence to conclude their worth and nobleneſs: But the clear Sun-light of Scripture advantageth unto a fuller diſcovery of its excellency. It ſhews us its Original, that it is of Celestial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, created immediately by the Father of Spirits, a beam of the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a bubble of the Fountain of Life, of a much higher deſcent then the <hi>Houſe of Clay,</hi> and <hi>earthly Tabernacle</hi> the Body, <hi>Gen. 2.7. Heb. 12.9. Zach. 12.1.</hi> It acquaints us with its duration, that it runs parallel with the line of eternity, and ſwallows up Years and Ages, and Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and thouſands of thouſands, and mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of millions, as ſmall drops and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and nothings in the bottomleſs Ocean, and endleſneſs of its abode and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. When the Body, like the Sacrifice, falleth to the Earth, and is turned into aſhes;
<pb facs="tcp:64652:3"/> the Soul, like the Flame, aſpireth and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth to God, <hi>Eccleſ. 12.7. Philip. 1.23. Math. 10.28. Math. 22.31, 32.</hi> It manifesteth the Souls capacity, how no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is excepted from its conſideration, all are within its compaſs and horizon; It can view every with its intellectual Eye. It is not bounded with corporeal Beings, nor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited with material Objects, nor circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed with created Eſſences; but is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of apprehending the firſt Cauſe, the Being of Beings, the Original of all things. It is able not only to retroſpect upon its own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to ſurvey the ſeveral parts, and ranks, and orders, and rarities, and delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and excellencies of the Earth, and this ſublunary World; but alſo to aſcend to the highest Heavens, and behold the beautiful Face of the bleſſed God, till it hath lookt it ſelf into the very likeneſs, and thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it ſelf fit and meet for his deareſt Love, and eternal Embraces.</p>
            <p>The excellency of our Souls doth emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently appear in its receptiveneſs of the <hi>Divine Image:</hi> (Great Princes do not ſtamp their Image on mean things, as Braſs and Pewter, but on the moſt excellent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, as Silver and Gold,) <hi>Eph. 4.23, 24.
<pb facs="tcp:64652:4"/> Coloſſ. 3.10. Gen. 1.26.</hi> And its capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of <hi>enjoying immediately the bleſſed God.</hi> To ſtand before Kings doth both ſpeak and make a perſon honourable and worthy.<note place="margin">Prov. 22.29. Iſa. 43.5.</note> God alone is the Fountain of Honour, and the Standard of Excellency; Every Being is his Coin, and he ſtampeth on it the rate it ſhall go at. The Holineſs and Happineſs of the rational Creature conſist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in theſe two: His Holineſs, in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God; his Happineſs, in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him: And theſe two have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on each other. They onely who are like him, can enjoy him: <hi>If we ſay we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we lie, and the Truth is not in us, 1</hi> John <hi>1.5.</hi> Holineſs, or the Image of God, is not onely an indiſpenſable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without which no man ſhall enjoy God, <hi>Heb. 12.14. John 3.3.</hi> But withall an abſolutely neceſſary diſpoſition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no man can enjoy God, <hi>Coloſſ. 1.12. 2 Cor. 5.</hi> And as Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity diſpoſeth for Communion, ſo Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion increaſeth Conformity; Viſion cauſeth aſſimulation in Nature, <hi>Gen. 31.38, 39.</hi> Grace, <hi>2 Cor. 3.18.</hi> And glory, <hi>1 John 3.2.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:64652:4"/>
            <p>Though the motions of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Will are in ſome reſpect circular, yet the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding is the first mover, and the leading faculty, and ſo the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the bleſſed God is both antecedent to, and productive of this Image. Though the knowledge of Creatures puffeth up, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteth, and ſo debaſeth and deſtroyeth the Soul, (ſinking it the deeper into Hell; as a Veſſel laden with Silver and Gold, and the most precious Commodities, when it miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrieth, ſinketh the deeper for its weight and burden,) <hi>1 Cor. 8.1. Luke 12.47, 48.</hi> Yet the Knowledge of God is humbling, advancing, purifying and ſaving, <hi>Job 42. 2 Peter 3.18. John 17.3.</hi> The incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable excellency of the boundleſs bleſſed God, is the Subject of this Treatiſe which I preſent to you both, as a Teſtimony of the Honour and Service I owe to you, and of my deſire to be instrumental for your ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and eternal good. The Subject is the higheſt imaginable; and though the manner of handling it be plain and ordinary, and infinitely below and unbecoming the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty, <hi>(For who can expreſs his noble Acts, or diſplay all his Praiſe,</hi> Pſal. <hi>108.2.</hi>) yet the matter of it doth deſerve,
<pb facs="tcp:64652:5"/> and may prevail for your acceptance of it.</p>
            <p>If Knowledge be the excellency of a Man, and differenceth him from a Beast; ſurely then Divine Knowledge, or the Knowledge of God in Christ, is the excellency of a Christian, and differenceth him from other Men. Our awe of, love to, and truſt in the Divine Majesty, are founded in the right knowledge of him. Creatures, the more they are known, the leſs they are eſteemed; but the more the bleſſed God is known, the more he is prized, deſired and obeyed, <hi>Pſal. 73.25. Pſal. 76.7. Pſal. 90.11. Pſal. 9.10.</hi> Our hatred of Sin, and contempt of the World, proceed from our acquaintance with God: He onely hath hateful thoughts of Sin, and ſelf-loathing apprehenſions becauſe of it; who hath ſeen the great and glorious, the good and gracious God, whoſe Authority is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, whoſe Law is violated, whoſe Name is diſhonoured, whoſe Image is defaced, and whoſe Love is abuſed by it, <hi>Job 42.6. Iſa. 6.5.</hi> He onely lives above this preſent evil World, and all the Riches, and Honours, and Pleaſures thereof; who can look beyond it, to the infinite God, and thoſe unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Riches, and Weights of Glory, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Pleaſures, that are in and with him.
<pb facs="tcp:64652:5"/> That which was rich and glorious, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to a Soul before, hath now no worth, no glory, no pleaſure, by reaſon of that wealth, and glory, and pleaſure which doth ſo infinitely exceed. When <hi>the God of Glory</hi> appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> he quickly and quietly left his Country and Kindred, and followed God, not knowing whither he went, <hi>Gent 12.1, 2. Acts 7.3.</hi> If the God of Glory appear to your Souls, you will ſoon wink upon theſe withering Vanities, broken Cisterns, and gilded Nothings, and count them all but Dung and Droſs, for the excellency of the Knowledge of him in Christ.</p>
            <p>You have begun well, go on and perſevere in well-doing: I ſhall give you the ſame Counſel which the Holy Apoſtle giveth to thoſe of whom he was perſwaded, that they <hi>had thoſe things which accompanied Salvation,</hi> Heb. <hi>6.9. Take heed leaſt there be in you an evil heart of unbelief, whereby ye ſhould depart away from the living God,</hi> Heb. <hi>3.12. Look dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, leaſt ye ſhould fail of the Grace of God,</hi> Heb <hi>12.15.</hi> When falſe Coin is common abroad, we are the more careful what Money we take; when much falſe
<pb facs="tcp:64652:6"/> Grace is up and down amongst us, and ſo many pleaſe themſelves with their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, or ſpiritual Priviledges, or ſacred Performances, or ſiding with this or that Party, &amp; form of Worſhip, or the reſpect and repute they have with others: It concerns you to be the more ſuſpicious of your Selves, leaſt you ſhould fail of that Grace of God, which conformeth the Heart to the nature, and the life to the Will and Law of God.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:64652:7"/> renders his works of darkneſs the more groſs and palpable. I mention not theſe things, as ſuſpecting your integrity; but to provoke and quicken you to the greater care and circumſpection in your carriage and converſation.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is certain, that our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the other World will conſiſt in part in our perfect knowledge of the bleſſed and boundleſſe God: When we ſhall <hi>know him as we are known of him,</hi> we ſhall be bleſſed as he is bleſſed; and when <hi>we ſhall ſee him as he is, we ſhall be like him</hi> in purity and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; we ſhall be fully ſatisfied with his likeneſs and his love. Rich muſt be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64652:10"/> which the moſt large and noble facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of man his underſtanding ſhall receive, in its intimate acquaintance with, and clear &amp; full apprehenſion of the higheſt Truth. And it is as certain, that our holineſs in this World doth not a little depend upon our knowledge of him, whoſe <hi>Name alone is excellent.</hi> None wander from him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Fleſh and World before him, and in their whole lives walk contrary to him; but from their ignorance of him. <hi>They are eſtranged from the life of God</hi> (i. e. a ſpiritual heavenly converſation) <hi>through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their Hearts.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.18.</note> Dark corners of an Houſe are filled with Duſt, dark Cellars with Vermine, and dark Hearts with curſed Luſts: None are enlarged in deſires after God, or raviſhed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in God, or can caſt their Souls and all their Concerns on God; but thoſe that are acquainted with him. They who know his beauty and bounty, cannot but love him, and they who know his power and faithfulneſs, cannot but truſt him: <hi>They who know thy Name, will put their truſt in thee,</hi> Pſal. 9.10. Whence comes it to paſs, that Believers can trample on the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64652:10"/> Riches and Treaſures, and Wealth of this beggarly World, that they <hi>can lay</hi> their white and yellow Earth, their Silver and Gold <hi>at the Apoſtles Feet,</hi> that they can <hi>ſuffer the ſpoiling of their Goods</hi> (not onely patiently, but) <hi>joyfully;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10.34.</note> but from the knowledge of him who is true riches, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.11. Subſtance, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.21. an enduring Subſtance, <hi>Job</hi> 10.34. A bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Mine of unſearchable Riches, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. Whence is it that they can refuſe to be called the Sons of Kings Daughters, that they can contemn Honours and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſpurn Crowns and Scepters under their Feet, but from the knowledge of him who is their Crown of Glory, their Diadem of Renown, and the praiſe of all his Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25. That which to the ſenſual Worldling is ſo glorious, hath no glory in the Believers Eye, by reaſon of the Lord of Glory, who doth ſo infinitely excel. Whence is it, that they can <hi>hate Father, Mother, Wife, Child, Liberty;</hi> yea, <hi>Life</hi> it ſelf, and leave all at the Call and Command of their Maker, but from the knowledge of him who is (as <hi>Elkanah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Hannah</hi>) better to them then ten Sons, then all Relations, then the whole
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64652:11"/> Creation. Thoſe <hi>Stars</hi> vaniſh and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, when once this <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſeth:</hi> How quickly, how quietly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any heſiſtancy or reluctancy, will <hi>Abraham</hi> leave his Country and Kindred, and Fathers Houſe, when once <hi>the God of Glory appeareth to him,</hi> Acts 9.2, 3, 4. In a word, whence is it, that they <hi>eſcape the pollutions of the World</hi> (in which others are mired, drown'd and deſtroyed,) <hi>but through the knowledge of God.</hi> 2 Pet. 2.20. Well may our Lord Jeſus ſay, <hi>It is life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> To know God affectionately, as our chiefeſt good, ſo as to give him our ſuperlative eſteem, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt love, is <hi>ſpiritual life</hi> here, in the habit or principle, as alſo in the act and exerciſe of it; and it is the beginning ſeed, preparation &amp; way of our <hi>eternal life</hi> hereafter. But who can know that being which infinitely paſſeth all knowledge: He that would know God fully, muſt be God himſelf; and he who would tell you what God is in any meaſure anſwerable to his excellency, had need <hi>to know him as he is known of him.</hi> And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing I were able to ſpeak of the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, as one that, like the great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64652:11"/> had been caught up <hi>into the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens:</hi> I queſtion whether, if I had a Tongue to ſpeak of him after that manner, ye had Ears to hear of him, or Hearts to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what I ſhould ſpeak. But though I am not able to ſpeak, nor you to hear of God, according to his perfection, yet through the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt ſo much may be ſpoken and heard of him, as may tend to our preſent Sanctification and future Salvation. Though we cannot <hi>ſee him as he is,</hi> yet we may ſee him <hi>as he is not;</hi> though the height of his being be above the reach of our Underſtandings, we may get ſome-what nearer to him (and indeed we have no other way while we are here then) by climbing upon the ſhoulders of all created excellencies, and there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming, <hi>That none in the Heavens is to be compared to the Lord, that none among the Sons of the Mighty is like unto the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the words, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> compareth God with, and prefereth God before the higheſt, the greateſt in Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p>In the words we have a Compariſon and a Praelation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>Compariſon,</hi> and this is between God and thoſe that are moſt excellent in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64652:12"/> Heaven, and the mightieſt on Earth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A <hi>Praelation,</hi> or preferring God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever is excellent in Heaven or Earth: The Interrogation is a ſtrong ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as is frequent in Scripture, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Who can ſay I have made my Heart clean, I am pure from my Sin;</hi> i. e. None can ſay I have made my Heart clean, or am pure from my Sin. So Exod. 15.11. <hi>Who is like to thee, O Lord, among the gods? Who is like thee, glorious in Holineſs, fearful in Praiſes, doing Wonders;</hi> that is, None is like Thee among the gods, none is ſo glorious in Holineſs, ſo fearful in Praiſes, ſuch a wonder-working God as thou art. Thus the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> underſtandeth the Text, For <hi>who in the Heavens is to be compared to the Lord? Who among the Sons of the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can be likened to the Lord;</hi> i. e. None in the Heavens, none among the Sons of the Mighty on Earth is comparable to <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah.</hi>

               <p>For this cauſal Particle gives the reaſon why Saints and Angels ſhould joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64652:12"/> in the praiſe of God. <hi>The Heavens ſhall praiſe thy Wonders, O Lord,</hi>

                  <hi>thy faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs alſo in the Congregation of the Saints: For who in the Heavens is to be compared to the Lord.</hi> By the Heavens <hi>Calvin</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth the holy Angels, who rejoyce in the Churches welfare, and bleſs God for preſerving his People, and performing his Promiſes to them; and 'tis apparent by the Apoſtle, that Angels are preſent in the Congregation of the Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.11. And ſo this Text addeth another Ground for their admiration of the great God, <hi>viz.</hi> his incomparable excellency. His high and matchleſs Perfections, call for high and matchleſs Praiſes. Others take the Text as a ground for the confirmation of the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> Faith in the Covenant God had made with him, mentioned <hi>Verſe</hi> 3, 4. namely, God's Superiority over Angels in Heaven, and Men on Earth; therefore they cannot hinder him in the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Word, being infinitely inferior to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who in the Heavens?</hi> Who in the <hi>Skie? Ainſworth</hi> reads it. In the <hi>Clouds (in Nubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus aequabitur),</hi> is to be equal'd (ſaith <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>) to <hi>Jehovah, Quis enim in ſuperiore

               <p>
                  <hi>Who in the Heavens?</hi> i. e. ſay ſome, in the Starry-Heavens, among the Coeleſtial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Sun, Moon or Stars; which were ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as gods, not onely by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> but alſo by ſome Idolatrous <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe of their brightneſs and beauty, their luſtre and glory.

               <p>
                  <hi>Who in the Heavens? i. e.</hi> ſay others, in the Heaven of Heavens, the higheſt, the third Heavens, among the Coeleſtial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>Cherubims</hi> and <hi>Seraphims, Angels</hi> and <hi>Arch-Angels, Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers, Thrones</hi> and <hi>Dominions?</hi> Who among the innumerable company of Angels? who among thoſe pure, thoſe perfect Spirits (who are the ancienteſt, the honourableſt Houſe of the Creation) is to be compared to the Father of Spirits?</p>

               <p>THe Doctrine which I ſhall raiſe out of the words, is this, That God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable; Or, there is none among the higheſt, the holieſt, in Heaven or Earth like unto <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Take the greateſt, the moſt excellent of Beings in this or the other World, yet they come infinitely ſhort of this Being of Beings? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.8. <hi>Among the gods, there is none like unto thee, O Lord;</hi> Mark, the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> doth not chooſe a weak Adverſary for God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with and conquer, but the ſtrongeſt. He doth not compare God with the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and loweſt, but even with the higheſt, and prefers God before them. <hi>Among the gods, there is none like unto thee, O Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Among thoſe that are Gods by <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just uſurpation,</hi> as <hi>evil Angels</hi> are, who are called <hi>The Princes of the Powers of the Air,</hi> Eph. 2.2. And the gods of this World, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. Or, as Antichriſt, <hi>who exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, or is worſhipped; So that he as God ſitteth in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64652:15"/> Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.4. Among theſe, there is none like unto thee, O Lord. Theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Beaſts are unworthy to be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the High, the holy God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Among thoſe that are gods by mens <hi>erroneous Perſwaſions</hi> and Opinions, as Idols, and thoſe Deities which the Heathen worſhip; There is none like to thee, O Lord. <hi>Their Idols are Silver and Gold, the Work of mens hands: They have Mouths, but they ſpeak not, Eyes have they, but they ſee not. They have Ears, but they hear not; Noſes have they, but they ſmell not: They have Hands, but they handle not; Feet have they, but they walk not, neither ſpeak they through their Throat,</hi> Pſal. 115.4, 5, 6, 7. Idols are the work of the Creatures, and their Makers are infinitely below the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; therefore they themſelves are much more. <hi>We know that an Idol is nothing in the World, and that there is none other God but one,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.4. Though an Idol be ſomewhat materially, yet it's nothing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, as to the intent or purpoſe for which it is worſhipped.</p>

(who have the Image of a Deity ſtamped on them, in their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Dominion over others,) none is to be compared to <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Theſe are gods by derivation, by deputation; as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Magiſtrates are commiſſionated by the Supreme, and have a Beam of his Power communicated to them, but ſtill remain weak Creatures, limited by his Precepts, and liable to his Judgment. So Angels and Kings have ſome impreſſions of a Deity on them; but their Power is derivative from God, and limited by his will; yea, their <hi>Eſſence</hi> is from him, their Subſiſtence is by him, and their Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is every moment upon him. Hence he is called the moſt high, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.1. <hi>O thou most high.</hi> Kings and Princes are <hi>high,</hi> Angels and Arch-angels are <hi>higher;</hi> but <hi>Jehovah</hi> onely is the <hi>most high, Eccleſ.</hi> 5.8. He that is higher then the higheſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth.</p>
               <p>For the explication of this Doctrine, the truth of it will be evident, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the true God, and compare him with the higheſt, and moſt excellent in Heaven and Earth.</p>

               <p>By Name, is meant ſometimes any thing whereby God makes himſelf known, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.7. But here the Being of God, or God himſelf, as Prov. 18.10. <hi>The Name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower; i. e.</hi> God himſelf is a ſtrong Tower, Pſal. 76.1. <hi>His Name is great in</hi> Iſrael; <hi>i. e.</hi> The Being of the great God is magnified in his Church, or among his Choſen. Now his Being alone is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, becauſe there is no ſuch Being as his: There is no Being excellent beſides his, becauſe there is no Being excellent like his. He is excellent in all, above all, and beyond all.</p>
               <p>His Being is ſuch a Being, that he alone <hi>is,</hi> and all beſides are <hi>non entities,</hi> and no Beings in compariſon of him. His Name
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64652:16"/> ſpeaks the incomparable nature of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>And God ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>Thus ſhalt thou ſay unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>I am hath ſent thee.

               <p>THe incomparableneſs of the Divine Being, will appear in ſeveral particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Being is <hi>from himſelf;</hi> No Being in the World, beſide his, is its own Cauſe or Original: Angels, Men, the higheſt, yea the loweſt Creatures, are derivative Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: They have what they are from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even from God; They are drops that flow from the Ocean of all Beings; they are Rays, derived from the Sun, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Light and Entity. The Apoſtle tells us, That Men are beholden to God for their Beings, Acts 17.28. <hi>In him we have our Beings.</hi> They were nothing till he ſpake them into ſomething: He form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and faſhioned their Bodies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64652:18"/> 13, 14, 15. He created and infuſed their Souls; He put that Heaven-born Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant into the Houſe of Clay, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Job</hi> 10.11, 12. The whole viſible World is his Workmanſhip, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.24. God that made the World, and all things therein; The inviſible World are alſo the effects of his powerful word: Angels as well as Men may thank him for what they are. The greateſt Angel is as much bound to him for his Being, as the ſmalleſt Atome, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.16. <hi>For by him were all things created that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, viſible and inviſible; whether they be Thrones or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, or Principalities, or Powers.</hi> But God is beholden to none for his Being: He was when none elſe was, even from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.1. Therefore none could contribute the leaſt to his Being: <hi>I am</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, <hi>and there is none elſe beſides me,</hi> Iſa. 45.5, 6. I am he that giveth a being to himſelf, that am what I am from my ſelf, and of my ſelf; and there is no ſuch Being beſide me.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God is Being, that is, <hi>for himſelf;</hi> as he is his own firſt Cauſe, ſo he is his own <hi>last end;</hi> as he is wholly from himſelf, ſo he is wholly for himſelf. All other Beings are not for themſelves, but for another.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64652:18"/> 
                  <hi>All things were created by him and for him,</hi> Coloſſ. 1.16. Since all are from God, it is but reaſon that all ſhould be for God: The Rivers that run from the Sea, return to the Sea again, owning and acknowledging their Original, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.7. Good Men are for God. <hi>None of us liveth to himſelf, or dyeth to himſelf; but whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we dye, we dye unto the Lord; and whether we live or dye, we are the Lords,</hi> Rom. 14.7. Good Angels are for God, for his glory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.3. Evil Men, evil Angels are for God, though not in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and purpoſes, yet in his intention, and by his wiſe powerful Government of them, and their practices; Prov. 16.4. <hi>The Lord made all things for himſelf, even the Wicked for the day of Slaughter.</hi> Good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are for him intentionally, and evil Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are for him eventually. Nay, all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are for him: <hi>Of him, and through him, and for him are all things,</hi> Rom. 11.36. But God is altogether for himſelf, as his higheſt end, and not for any others. He is his own end, as well as his own beginning; who never had a beginning, nor ſhall ever have an end, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.8. As all God doth is for himſelf, Revel. 4.11. <hi>Thou haſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64652:19"/> all things, and for thy pleaſure they are and were created.</hi> So all God is is for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: He is infinite, wiſe, almighty, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, unchangeable, holy, righteous, faithful Being, is for himſelf. It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs of ſome Men to be ſomewhat for God; more for the World, and moſt of all for their carnal ſelves: But it is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of God, to be ſomewhat for the World in general; more for his Elect in ſpecial, and moſt of all for Himſelf; Nay, in all that he is for the World, or his Elect; he is ſtill moſt for himſelf. It is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and purity of Saints and Angels to be what they are, and to do what they do for God, to make him who is the efficient, the final Cauſe of their Beings and Actions. But 'tis the excellency and purity of God, to be what he is, and to do what he doth for himſelf: He who is his own happineſs, muſt be his own end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His Being is an <hi>independent</hi> Being: He is by himſelf, as well as from and for himſelf; None ever in Heaven or Earth contributed the leaſt towards the maintenance or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of his Being; Neither the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures goodneſs, nor their Goods do him the leaſt good. Not their <hi>goodneſs;</hi> Men
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64652:19"/> may be advantaged by the goodneſs of Men, but God cannot: <hi>My goodneſs extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to thee, but to the Saints that are on Earth,</hi> Pſal. 16.3. Not their <hi>Goods,</hi> He is the Lord Proprietor of the whole world, and if he wanted any thing, he would not ask the leave of any; for all is his own, but he is above all want: <hi>If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; for the World is mine, and the fulneſs thereof,</hi> Pſal. 50.12. <hi>i. e.</hi> I declare to the World, That I am uncapable of the leaſt want; or if I needed a Meals-Meat, I would ſcorn to go to the Creatures Door to beg it: I could ſupply my ſelf out of my own Store, if there were need, but there is no need at all. He challengeth all the World, to produce any Being that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obliged or ingaged him in the leaſt: <hi>Who hath prevented me, that I may repay him,</hi> Job 41.11. Where is the Man, where is the Angel, where is the Creature that can ſay, He ever did me the leaſt kindneſs, that hath been before-hand with me in courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, to whom I am the leaſt in debt for my ſubſiſtance? I am here ready to make him amends: <hi>Who hath prevented me, that I may repay him?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64652:20"/>
               <p>But all other Beings are dependent, the higheſt, the ſtrongeſt of them are not able to bear their own weight; but like the Hop or Ivy, muſt have ſomewhat to lean upon: <hi>By him all things ſubſist,</hi> Coloſſ. 1.17. He preſerveth them in their Beings, and in their Motions; <hi>In him we live and move, and have our Beings,</hi> Acts 17.28. As the Beams depend on the Sun, and the Streams on the Fountain; ſo do the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for their beings and actions depend on God. <hi>He upholdeth all things</hi> (as the Foundation the Building) <hi>by the word of his Power,</hi> Hebr. 1.3. He is the Atlas, that bears up the whole World, without whom it would fall to nothing. Thou preſerveſt Man and Beaſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6. <hi>Dependentia est de eſſentia Creaturae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God is to the World, as the Soul to the Body; He animates and actuates every thing in it, and enableth his ſeveral Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to all their motions. Men are apt to think that Fire can burn of it ſelf, it being ſo natural to the Fire to burn; yet if God do but ſuſpend his influence (<hi>actum ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> as they ſpeak) a Furnace heated ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times hotter then uſual, burns no more then Water, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.27. We are ready
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64652:20"/> to conceive, that it's eaſie for a Man to ſee, when the Organ is rightly diſpoſed; there is a fit <hi>medium,</hi> and a due diſtance of the Organ from the Object: But yet if God deny his concurrence, though there are theſe three Requiſites to ſight, a man can ſee no more then if he were ſtark blind, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.11. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.18.</p>
               <p>Angels themſelves muſt have their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker for their mover; or as active Spirits as they are, they muſt ſtand ſtill.</p>

               <p>HE is an <hi>abſolutely perfect</hi> Being: There is a two-fold perfection competible to Beings; Some are perfect <hi>in their kind,</hi> that is, have all things requiſite to that Species of which they are. So we ſay the World is perfect, becauſe it hath all things needful to a World. A man is a perfect man, that hath a body with all its parts and members, and a Soul with all its powers
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64652:21"/> and faculties: But ſecondly, A Being is <hi>abſolutely</hi> perfect, when nothing can be added to it, or taken from it, when it is uncapable of the leaſt Acceſſion or Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution. Now ſuch a Being is God, and none but God. As the Sun gets nothing by the ſhining of the Moon and the Stars, neither loſeth any thing by their Eclipſes, or withdrawing. So the ſelf ſufficient God gains nothing by all the Suits and Services, Prayers and Praiſes of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; neither looſeth any thing by their neglect of their Duties. He is above the influence of all our performances; our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs addeth not the leaſt to his Happineſs. <hi>Can a Man be profitable to God, as he that is wiſe may be profitable to himſelf? Is it any pleaſure to the Almighty that thou art righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous? or is it gain to him that thou makest thy wayes perfect?</hi> Job 22.2, 3. He is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the malice of Sin: As Holineſs doth not help him, ſo the Sin of his Creatures doth not hurt him. All thoſe Darts of Sin which the Wicked ſhoot up againſt Heaven, fall ſhort, and fall down upon their own Heads. <hi>If thou ſinneſt, what doſt thou againſt him? or if thy Tranſgreſſions be multiplyed, what doſt thou unto him?
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64652:21"/> If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? Thy Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may hurt a Man, as thou art, and thy Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs may profit the Sons of Men,</hi> Job 35.6. 7, 8. Fleſh and Blood may be injured and pierced by the Weapons of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but not the Rock of Ages, that is impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable. They who are of the ſame make and mold with our ſelves, may be advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by our Bleſſings and Praiſes, but not he who is above all Bleſſing and Praiſes.</p>
               <p>What doth the great Light of the World get by the <hi>Perſians</hi> admiration and adoration of it. What is a Fountain the better, if Men drink of its water, and commend it; or the worſe, if Men paſs by, and deſpiſe it. What would God get, if he ſhould make millions of Worlds to land and magnifie him; or what would God looſe, if there were no World, no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at all? <hi>Who hath given to him, and it ſhall be recompenced again?</hi> Rom. 11, 35. He hath given to all what-ever they are, or have; but none ever gave to him. They who give to him their Love, and Fear, and Truſt, and Names, and Eſtates, give nothing to him. We can give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him, to whom we owe all: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64652:22"/> all we have, and are, and do, and ſuffer for him, addeth nothing to him. His <hi>declarative</hi> glory may, but his <hi>eſſential</hi> glory, or glorious eſſence admits not in the leaſt of any increaſe or decreaſe. But no other Being is abſolutely perfect; Men are exceeding imperfect, ſince their Falls: They are ſo far from being above all addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they ſtand in continual need of Additions. They need the Air to breath in, the Earth to bear them, Food to ſtrengthen them, Rayment to cover them, Fire to warm them, Sleep to refreſh them; They want Righteouſneſs to juſtifie them, the Holy Ghoſt to ſanctifie them, Love to comfort them, and Mercy to ſave them. Man is an heap of Infirmities, an Hoſpital of Diſeaſes, and a bundle of Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: He is ſo far from being abſolutely perfect, that (in a moral conſideration) ſince his Apoſtacy, he is not perfect in his kind. And though Angels are more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then Men, yet they are imperfect to God: Angels, 'tis true, are perfect in their kind, but not perfect in all kinds; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be added to them, ſomething may be taken from them. The higheſt Angel may be higher, and the holieſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64652:22"/> may be holier, and the beſt of them may be better. Though the Stars differ from each other in brightneſs and glory, yet none of them is a Sun: Though Angels differ from Men, and each from others in honour and excellency; yet none of them is a god, none of them is abſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God is an <hi>univerſal</hi> Being, he hath all good eminently and virtually in himſelf: Whatſoever excellencies are ſcattered and diſperſed among the Creatures in Heaven or in Earth, they are all united in, and centered after an infinite manner in the Creator. It's a true Rule in Phyloſophy, <hi>Quod efficit tale est magis tale;</hi> Whatſoever good is in the effect, is more abundantly in the cauſe: Now God being the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and cauſe of all the good and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that is in every Creature, it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be more abundantly in him. As ſome Potions have the quinteſſence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Herbs, many Drugs in them; ſo God hath the quinteſſence of all Creatures, and infinitely more in him.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe he is called by, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to whatſoever is good and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, either to neceſſity, conveniency or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64652:23"/> delight. Sometimes to that good which is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> as to <hi>life, John</hi> 1.4. To the <hi>Fountain of life,</hi> Pſal. 36.9. To <hi>Light,</hi> John 1.9. To the <hi>Father of Lights,</hi> James 1.17. To Food, as to <hi>Bread;</hi> yea, <hi>living Bread,</hi> John 6.51. To <hi>water,</hi> yea <hi>living water,</hi> John 4.10. To <hi>Rest, Return to thy Rest, O my Soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee,</hi> Pſal. 116.7. He is the onely Ark, wherein alone the Dove wearied about the waters of this World, can find reſt: Sometimes he is compared to that good which is <hi>convenient,</hi> as to an <hi>Habitation,</hi> Pſal. 90.9, 10. <hi>O Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place from all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> To Health, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>ult.</hi> To Peace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11.

To <hi>Good,</hi> which is the delight of the Will, <hi>Math.</hi> 19.17. Thus God is not one good, but all good: The truth is, all the good, all the excellencies that are in Men or Angels, are not worthy to be a ſhadow, or foyl to ſet off thoſe excellencies that are in God. All good is in one God, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.29, 30. But Creatures are but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Beings: Man is but a particular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64652:24"/> a low limited Being. What is <hi>Man, that is a Worm; or the Son of Man that is a Worm,</hi> Job 25.6. There is ſome good in one man, and ſome good in another man; but not all good in any man, no, not in all men. Angels are but particular Beings, little Beings: One Angel is one drop, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angel another drop, a third Angel a third drop; every one is but a drop: None of them is an Ocean, as God is, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth all thoſe drops, and infinitely more.</p>
               <p n="6">6. God is an <hi>unchangeable</hi> Being, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without, but uncapable of the leaſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration. He is the <hi>ſame Yeſterday, to Day, and for Ever,</hi> Heb. 13.8. He is what he was, and what he will be eternally. He is the ſame ſince the World was made, that he was before the World, and that he will be when this World ſhall be no more: <hi>With him is not the least variation, or ſhadow of turning,</hi> James 1.17. No <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or variableneſs: It is an Aſtronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal word, taken from the heavenly Bodies, which ſuffer many Declenſions and Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, which they call <hi>Parallaxes.</hi> Though thoſe heavenly Lights are variable, have their increaſes and decreaſes; their times
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64652:24"/> of riſing and ſetting; yet our Father of Lights is not variable: He knoweth no riſing or ſetting, no increaſing or decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; but ſhineth alwayes with the ſame light and <hi>lustre,</hi> with the ſame beauty and brightneſſe. Nor ſhadow of Turning, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The leſſer Luminaries, or Stars, according to their different Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, have divers ſhadowings, or obum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations, according to their nearneſs to, or diſtance from the Sun, their ſhadows are greater or leſſer; but our Sun is ſtill the ſame, knoweth no clouding, no ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no eclipſing. When God hates thoſe Angels as Apoſtates, whom firſt he loved, as created pure and holy, he is ſtill the ſame; the change is not in God, but in them. Bring Clay to the Sun, it hardens it; bring Wax to the Sun, with the ſame influence, it ſoftens it, without any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Sun: When God puniſheth a Man that is wicked, and proſpereth the ſame Man, becoming a Penitent, he is ſtill the ſame. If a man walk on one ſide of a Church, the Pillars are on his left hand, if on the other ſide, on his right hand: The Pillars remain where they were, the motion or change is in the Man.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:64652:25"/>
               <p>But Creatures are all mutable; the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſeem conſtant, but it is in incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy; their perpetual motion ſpeaks their perpetual alteration: Pſal. 102.26, 27. <hi>They ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt endure, they ſhall wax old as a Garment,</hi> (that is, wearing out, and waſting every day); <hi>as a Vesture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed, but thou Lord art the ſame for ever.</hi> The old Heavens will paſs away, and new ones ſucceed in their room at the general Conflagration, but the God of Heaven will never paſs away. Man is ever in motion, from one condition to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: His Body changeth in its age, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, temper, at laſt into rottenneſſe, duſt and corruption: <hi>I have ſaid to Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thou art my Father, and to the Wormes, ye are my Brother and Sister,</hi> Job 17.14. His Soul changeth in its paſſions, affections, love hatred, delights, deſires: His whole man changeth in its place, company, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, converſation: He hath no conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy while he is, he continueth not what he was, <hi>Job</hi> 14.2, 3. Angels are changeable, even the good Angels, though not as Men, yet as Creatures; as perfect as they are, they have this imperfection, 1. They are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64652:25"/> who once were not, and (in regard of themſelves) have a poſſibility not to be. 2. Angels may looſe what they have, and attain what they have not. 3. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are mutable in regard of place, ſometimes in Heaven, ſometimes on Earth. What little unchangableneſs is in Angels, is derivative, God is the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of it; their immutability at moſt is but from their Creation I ſuppoſe ſome time ſince; for the good Angels as well as bad were created mutable, but Gods immutability is from eternity. The whole World indeed is a Sea of Glaſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.6. alwayes ebbing and flowing, never at a ſtay; but the Maker of the World may well ſay, <hi>I the Lord change not,</hi> Mal. 3.6.</p>

               <p>GOd is an <hi>eternal</hi> Being, and none is eternal but he: <hi>Time</hi> which hath a beginning and end is competible
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64652:26"/> to Men, and other viſible Creatures in this World. <hi>Aeriternity</hi> which hath a beginning, and no end, is competible to good and evil Angels, and to the Souls of Men; but <hi>Eternity</hi> which hath no beginning, ſucceſſion or end, belongs onely to God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God hath no <hi>beginning:</hi> He who <hi>in the beginning created the Heavens and the Earth,</hi> could have no beginning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Before the Mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the Earth and the World; from everlasting to everlasting thou art God,</hi> Pſal. 90.2. God is eternal, <hi>a parte ante,</hi> and puzleth the moſt enlarged Underſtanding, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his duration: <hi>Behold he is great, and we know him not, neither can the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his years be ſearched out,</hi> Job 36.26. Pſal. 93.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God hath no <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> in his Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He dwelleth in one indiviſible point of eternity; He is what he is in one infinite moment of being: His duration knoweth nothing of former or latter, paſt or to come: His Eſſence is not bounded by thoſe Hedges, but he enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his whole eternity every moment.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64652:26"/> Hence he is ſaid to <hi>inhabit eternity,</hi> to be fixt alwayes in eternity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. Time is <hi>nunc fluens,</hi> but eternity is <hi>nunc ſtans: One day with him is as a thouſand years, and a thouſand years as one day,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.8. He inhabits a million of years in a moment, and each moment to him is as a million of years: He hath not the leaſt added to his duration ſince the World was, though it hath been near 6000 years: It's not proper to ſay of him, He <hi>was</hi> (for none of his duration is ever paſt with him) or he <hi>ſhall be</hi> (for none of his duration is ever to come) but <hi>he is,</hi> his full eternity is alwayes preſent; Hence his Name is <hi>I am,</hi> Exod. 3.14. Not I was, or ſhall be; and Chriſt tells the <hi>Jews, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I am,</hi> John 8.58. It ſeems falſe Grammar, but it's the moſt proper true Divinity. Indeed, had <hi>Adam</hi> been then alive, it had been proper for him to have ſaid, <hi>Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I was;</hi> or if an Angel had ſpoken, it had been proper for him to have ſaid, <hi>Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I was,</hi> becauſe Men and Angels enjoy their Being by piece-meals, now a little and then a little, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of their duration is gone, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64652:27"/> to come; but it was moſt proper for him that was God to ſay, <hi>Before</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>was, I am,</hi> becauſe his duration is without all ſucceſſion, the whole of it is ever preſent: The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> further cleares this, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee,</hi> Pſal. 2.7. Which words are interpreted of the eternal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Son of God before all Worlds, and alſo of his Reſurrection in time, which was to be ſome hundreds of years after, as the Apoſtle either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it, or alludes to it, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.33. But it's all one, for both are <hi>to day;</hi> that which was from eternity, and that which was to be many hundred of years after, are both with him preſent <hi>this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Paſt or future is all preſent <hi>this day;</hi> that was not <hi>past</hi> to God, which never had beginning, his Sons eternal Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor was that <hi>to come</hi> to God, which was alwayes before him, his Sons Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Reſurrection. 'Tis ſtill, <hi>this day have I begotten thee,</hi> millions of years, yea of Ages, add not the leaſt moment to his duration.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God hath <hi>no ending:</hi> As he is from, ſo he is to everlaſting, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.2. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64652:27"/> beginning or end of days; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.27. <hi>But thou art the ſame, and thy years never end.</hi> O what an excellent Being is this eternal Being? <hi>He onely hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.16. And he is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it ſelf, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.29. <hi>Aeternitas Iſraelis,</hi> Jun. <hi>The eternity of</hi> Iſrael <hi>cannot lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But are Men or Angels comparable to <hi>God</hi> in this? Surely no: As for Man, he is a Bird of Time, here to day, and gone to morrow, <hi>Job</hi> 14.1. Of <hi>few days:</hi> As for <hi>Man, his days are as Graſs,</hi> Pſal. 103.15. Now flouriſhing, but quickly periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Man hath a beginning, ſucceſſion and ending. There was a Time when Man was not, Man enjoyeth his time by parts and parcels, and Man ere long ſhall be no more. All men in this are alike, high or low, good or bad: There is a vaſt difference between God and all Men in their duration; <hi>Are thy dayes as the dayes of Man? are thy years as Mans years?</hi> Job 10.5. No, in no reſpect; Man's days begin, ſucceed and end; not ſo God's dayes. Well might <hi>David</hi> ſay (though he had lived as long as <hi>Methuſelah), Mine
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64652:28"/> age is nothing unto thee,</hi> Pſal. 39.5. And truly as Men are far from being compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, ſo are Angels: Angels had a beginning, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.16. Angels have a ſucceſſion in their duration, they enjoy part to day, part to morrow, part the next day, every moment addeth to their duration; what is paſt they do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, nor what is to come, but onely what is preſent; and thus it is alſo with Souls of Saints in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="8">8. God is a <hi>ſimple</hi> Being: In this I take ſimplicity, not as oppoſed to <hi>Wiſdom</hi> (for in him are all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.9.) but as ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity is oppoſed to <hi>mixture</hi> and <hi>compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiton.</hi> Thus there is a ſimplicity in the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. So any thing, the more ſimple it is, the more excellent it is. God is a moſt pure ſimple unmixed indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Eſſence; he is uncapable of the leaſt compoſition, and therefore of the leaſt diviſion. He is one moſt pure, one without all parts, members, accidents and qualities: Whatſoever is in him is himſelf, his very Being; therefore that which is a quality in a Man or Angel, is attributed to God in the abſtract: Men
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64652:28"/> and Angels are wiſe, but God is <hi>wiſdom, Prov.</hi> 9.1. Men and Angels are holy, but God is <hi>Holineſs,</hi> Iſa. 63.15. God is all Eſſence, all Being, and nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>But how unlike are Men or Angels to God in this: Man is a groſly compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being, he is compounded of a Body and a Soul, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. His body is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of members and parts, his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and parts are compounded of bones and bloud, and fleſh, and skin, and ſinews, <hi>Job</hi> 10.11. His Soul is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and ſo are the higheſt Angels of ſubſtance and accidents, of eſſence and faculties; the ſubſtance of Man's Soul, and of Angels, and their qualities, are diſtinct things: Their Wiſdome is one thing, their Power another thing, their Holineſs a third thing, and all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from their Eſſence. An Angel may be an Angel, and a Man may be a true Man, and yet be fooliſh, weak and wicked. Their Underſtanding differeth from their Wills, their Wills differ from their Affections, their Affections differ from both, and all from their beings: But in God all theſe are one indiviſible Eſſence, to will and to underſtand, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64652:29"/> to love and to hate, and to be, are all the ſame and one in God.</p>

               <p>God is an <hi>incomprehenſible</hi> Being, ſuch a Being as no Creature, whether Man or Angel can comprehend, or perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. This floweth from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; if he be infinite, he muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be incomprehenſible, for a finite Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as all are beſide himſelf) can never comprehend what is infinite. There is no proportion between a boundleſs Being and a bounded Underſtanding: But there muſt be a proportion between the mind of the Creature, and that object which is fully underſtood by it. The Sun may be contained in a ſmall chink, and the Sea in a Nutſhell, ſooner then God can be contained in the limited
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64652:31"/> underſtanding of Men or Angels; Job 26.14. <hi>Lo theſe are parts of his wayes,</hi> (viz. <hi>Hell is naked before him,</hi> ver. 6. <hi>He hangeth the Earth upon nothing,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>He bindeth up the Waters in his thick Clouds, and the Cloud is not rent under them,</hi> ver. 8. <hi>He hath compaſſed the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with bounds,</hi> ver. 10. <hi>The Pillars of Heaven tremble at his Reproof,</hi> ver. 11. &amp;c.) <hi>but how little a portion is heard of him.</hi> The Vulgar read it, <hi>How little a drop;</hi> Others, A <hi>whiſper,</hi> or ſmalleſt part of a Voice; that which is known of God, to that which God is, and is in God, is but like a drop to the vaſt Ocean; and as a Whiſper, to a loud terrible Thunder; <hi>How little a portion is heard of him.</hi> Surely much is heard of him, from the Voice of his Almighty Works of Creation and Providence, and eſpecially from the Voice of his Word and his own Mouth in the holy Scriptures: But <hi>how little</hi> is heard of him, in compariſon of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe excellency which is in him, and which he is.

               </p>
               <p>The Being of God is like the Peace of God, <hi>which paſſeth all underſtanding,</hi> Philip. 4.7. And like the Love of Chriſt, <hi>which paſſeth all knowledge,</hi> Epheſ. 3.19. This onely can be known of God, that he can never be known fully; and this onely can be comprehended of him, that he cannot be comprehended: <hi>Canſt thou by ſearching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection? It's as high as Heaven, what canst thou do? Deeper then Hell, what canſt thou know?

Doſt thou a poor mean vile man (ſaith <hi>Zophar</hi>) think to contain and comprehend him, whom the Heavens, and Heaven of Heavens cannot contain or comprehend?

Though he be not far from thee, yet he is far above thee, and far beyond thee; far above thy thoughts, and beyond thy conceptions: He <hi>dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in that Light that is inacceſſible, whom no man hath ſeen, nor can ſee,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.16. They who ſee him face to face, <hi>i. e.</hi> moſt clearly and fully ſee but little of him: Clouds and Darkneſs are in this ſenſe ever about him.

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of God may be known, but not all; They who find out moſt, are far from finding out the utmoſt of him. The Sun and all the coeleſtial Lights may ſooner be graſped in the hollow of mans

How frequently do the greateſt Schollars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to ſecret Sympathies and Antipathies, and occult qualities, as the Cloak and cover of their Ignorance: Eccleſ. 11.5. <hi>Canst thou know how the Bones grow of her that is with Child?</hi> O how much more muſt Divine queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons exceed humane underſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is as high as Heaven, what canſt thou do?</hi> It's as the highneſſes of Heaven: Take all the Heights and Elevations, all the Spheres and Altitudes of Heaven, and try if thou canſt reach them with thy ſhort Arm; yea, climb up the higheſt Stories, the loftieſt Pinnacles, touch, if thou canſt, the ſeveral Orbes; yet the knowledge of this God, or this God the object of knowledge, is above and beyond all. What a Fool would he be thought, who ſhould undertake to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend the ſtarry Heavens; yet he who would find out God to perfection, muſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64652:33"/> climb much higher. The Heavens are famous for their height; yea, the ſtarry Heavens, that ſome wonder that the eyes of man are not tired before they reach them; Prov. 25.3. <hi>The Heavens for height, and the Earth for depth;</hi> Yet the third Heavens are much higher then they; but the moſt high God is far higher then the higheſt Heavens.</p>

Who knoweth what is done in Heaven? what in Hell? what is enjoyed in the one, or ſuffered in the other? no more can any know what God is. Who knoweth the nature, number, order, motions, influence of the heavenly Bodies; ſomething is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturally delivered about them, nothing certain; much leſs doth any know the number, nature, order, wonder, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the coeleſtial Courtiers in the third Heavens, of the thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand that are before God, the ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times ten thouſand that miniſter to him; leaſt of all can any know that Being that made all theſe, that preſerveth

               <p>
                  <hi>Deeper then Hell, what canst thou know?</hi> Who knoweth the Mines and Minerals which lie in the boſome, in the bowels of the Earth? Who knoweth the place of Saphires, the Coral, the Pearls, and the precious Onix: Job 28.5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Out of the Earth cometh Bread, &amp;c. The ſtones of it are the place of Saphires, and it hath duſt of Gold: There is a path which no Fowl knoweth, and which the Vultures Eye hath not ſeen: The Lyons Whelps have not trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it, nor the fierce Lyon paſſed by it.</hi> Much leſs doth any know the Miſeries of the Damned, the extremity, univerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eternity of their Torments?

Leaſt of all can any know that God,<note place="margin">Job 28.3.</note> who ſetteth an end to Darkneſs, and ſearcheth out all Perfection; the ſtones of darkneſs and the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64652:34"/> ſhadow of Death: Before whom Hell and Deſtruction are naked and open; who formeth the coſtly Jewels, ſecret from the Eyes of covetous Mortals; who layeth the dark Vault of Hell, and ſtoreth it with Fire and Brimſtone, and gnawing Worms, and blackneſs of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all the Inſtruments of eternal Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The meaſure thereof is longer then the Earth:</hi> The Earth is long, from one end of it to another. Mathematicians tell us, from Eaſt to Weſt, it's 22000 miles, but the knowledge of God is much longer; the meaſure thereof is beyond all meaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And broader then the Sea:</hi> The Ocean is exceeding broad, it ſeems to them that Sail on it, to be without Banks or Bounds. Hence we read of the <hi>Arms</hi> of the Sea, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.22. becauſe of its breadth. And <hi>David</hi> calls it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.25. <hi>A great and wide Sea. So is this great and wide Sea, wherein are things innumerable, both ſmall and great.</hi> But the knowledge of the great God is far greater and wider: How are the Dimenſions of height, depth, length and breadth, in their greateſt extent and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64652:34"/> dimenſions obvious to humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings. The Heavens are high, yet their height is finite: Hell is deep, yet its depth is determined; the Earth is long, yet its length is limited; the Sea is broad, yet its breadth is bounded: But God is infinite, boundleſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all theſe.</p>

Syntag. lib. 2. cap. 6. There are ſome Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, which the School-men call <hi>Incommunicable,</hi> (which I have ſpoken of under the former Head) becauſe the Creature, as a Creature, is uncapable of them, and therefore they cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Man or Angels. It's impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a Creature to be independent, ſelf-ſufficient, eternal in a ſtrict ſenſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, &amp;c. ſo that all will acknowledge God incomparable in thoſe excellencies. There are other Attributes of God which are called <hi>Communicable, viz.</hi> His Power, Holineſs, Wiſdome, Faithfulneſs, &amp;c. becauſe they are communicated by him to his rational Creatures, and there is ſome ſhew or ſhadow of them in Men and Angels. For though it was the horrible Pride, and monſtrous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of evil Angels, and <hi>Adam,</hi> at firſt to rival God in his Properties, that were incommunicable; to aſpire to be like him in his Independency and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, (for their Sin was, that they

               <p>But even in theſe Properties, wherein Man reſembleth his Maker, he is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly unlike him, and falls infinitely ſhort of him. That God is incomparable in his communicable Attributes, I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>

               <p n="1">1. More generally, and here I ſhall enumerate ſome of thoſe Attributes, wherein Men and Angels are conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64652:36"/> to God, and in each of them ſhew that in thoſe in which they come neareſt him, they come far behind him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is incomparable in his <hi>Holineſs:</hi> Holineſs in general, is the <hi>moral goodneſs</hi> of a thing, or its <hi>conveniency</hi> or <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> with its <hi>rule.</hi> Holineſs in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is their conformity to the will of their Creator, in the principle rule and end of their actions and motions: Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in God is that excellency of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, by which he acteth from himſelf for himſelf, and according to his own will.</p>
               <p>God is <hi>the holy One,</hi> Hoſ. 11.9. by way of eminency and excellency, becauſe he ſurpaſſeth all others in holineſs. He is the <hi>holy One of Jacob,</hi> Iſa. 49.23. <hi>The holy One of Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 43.14. becauſe of their ſpecial intereſt and propriety in the excellent Being. He is <hi>holy, holy, holy,</hi> Iſa. 6.3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.8. His Nature is the <hi>onely pattern</hi> of Holineſs, therefore he commands us to look on him as our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; <hi>Be ye holy as I am holy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15, 16. Man was made holy, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. <hi>i. e.</hi> According to the Image of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. His will is the

                  <hi>onely rule</hi> of Holineſs: Hence our holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is called a <hi>proving his good and perfect and acceptable will,</hi> Rom. 12.2. and our fulfilling the will of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. And a walking according to his Word (which is his reveal'd will) as our Rule, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. He is univerſally holy in his Name, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.49. In his Nature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5, 6. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. In his Works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.17. In his Word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.140. He is the Original of all holineſs in Men or Angels; they are beholden to him that they are not as unholy as the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as the Devils, <hi>James</hi> 1.17. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.28. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.26, 27. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. Now what Man or Angel is comparable to him in holineſs. May I not, with <hi>Moſes,</hi> make a Challenge, <hi>Who is a God like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, glorious in holineſs?</hi> Exod. 15.11.</p>
               <p>Are Men holy as he is holy? nay, are the ſpirits of juſt Men made perfect, and Angels equal to him in holineſs? <hi>Behold, he putteth no trust in his Saints</hi> (the beſt on Earth) <hi>the Heavens</hi> (the holieſt there) <hi>are unclean in his ſight,</hi> Job 15.15, 16. As for man he is a Sink of Sin, a Stye of Filth, over-ſpread from Head to Foot
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64652:37"/> with the Leproſie of Sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. And therefore inſtead of comparing with God for holineſs, is bound to abhor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for his unholineſs; yea Angels, who have nothing amiſs in their Natures, who never took one ſtep awry in their lives, who have ever continued Gods Loyal Subjects, and faithful Servants, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of all his Calls, and obedient to all his Commands; whoſe obedience to him, and obſervance of him, is made the Copy for us to write after, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.10. are yet unholy in compariſon of God: <hi>The Heavens are unclean in his ſight.</hi> The Heavens, not onely the place which hath a relative holineſs, in regard of Gods ſpecial preſence; but even the perſons in Heaven, perfect Spirits, who have no blemiſh in their Beings, or diſorder in their motions, are unholy to him, and unclean in his ſight. The holineſs of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, is but the holineſs of obeying a Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20, 21. the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, is the holineſs of being a Law, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.3. The holineſs of Angels is but a conformity to the pattern ſet them, the holineſs of God is the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſetting them a pattern, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64652:37"/> their pattern. The holineſs of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels is but a derivative, Gods is an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal holineſs.</p>
               <p>God is ſo incomparable in holineſs, that it's ſaid, He onely, or ſolely, is holy, Revel. 15.4. <hi>Who will not fear thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy Name, for thou only art holy.</hi> None is holy beſides him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none is holy like him; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.2. <hi>There is none holy as the Lord,</hi> therefore none holy but the Lord: Saints are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. Angels are holy, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. But they are not holy as the Lord is holy. Without queſtion, the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hoſt who ſee him face to face, and are ſatisfied with his likeneſs, are glorious in holineſs, ſhine brightly with thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beams, and that pure light which they borrow from the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; but truly they are poor Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms to the Father of Lights. Even that Grace, that Holineſs, that Glory of Saints and Angels, which infinitely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth the natural Heavens in all their beauty and brightneſs, is no Grace, no Holineſs, no Glory in this reſpect, by reaſon of that Grace and Holineſs, and Glory in God, which doth ſo infinitely excel.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:64652:38"/>2. God is incomparable in his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> (I ſhall not ſtand upon the critical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions which ſome give between Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Prudence and Wiſdom): Wiſdom in general is a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things, and the ordering our ſelves and actions ſutable to that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. It appears chiefly in theſe three acts: 1. In diſcerning the nature, cauſes, effects, contraries, and conſequents of things, (of which we ſhall ſpeak here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after); and this we call <hi>Science.</hi> 2. In propounding the beſt, and higheſt, and nobleſt end to our ſelves, in our actions and undertakings; and this is called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi> 3. In ſuiting and fitting, and ordering the moſt proper means, as may be beſt for the attaining our ends; and this is called <hi>Prudence,</hi> which, as the Rudder of the Ship, ſteers, and directs and governs all. In all theſe reſpects God is incomparable in Wiſdom: He is <hi>wiſe in heart,</hi> Job 9.4. <hi>i. e.</hi> moſt wiſe, for the <hi>heart</hi> is the ſeat of Wiſdom. And to be fooliſh, and without an heart, is all one: <hi>Ephraim is a ſilly Dove, without an heart,</hi> Hoſ. 7.11. There are in God all the <hi>Treaſures of Wiſdom,</hi> Coloſſ. 1.19.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:64652:38"/>
               <p>A Treaſure denotes, 1. <hi>Preciouſneſs;</hi> an heap of Duſt or Coals is not a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but of <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold.</hi> 2. <hi>Plenty;</hi> one or two pieces of things that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious will not make a Treaſure, there muſt be an heap, or ſome quantity. In God there is the moſt precious Wiſdom, therefore called <hi>Counſell,</hi> the effect of ſerious and mature deliberation; and he is called <hi>The mighty Counſellor,</hi> Eph. 1.11. Iſa. 9.6. In God there is plenty of it, <hi>Treaſures;</hi> a Treaſure notes abundance, but Treaſures ſpeaks ſuperabundance, a redundance.

The ſubtilty of the Heathen (and, I may ſay, the greateſt underſtanding of the Chriſtian) is folly with God: <hi>The fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is wiſer than Man,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.25. If it were poſſible that there ſhould be any thing in God which might look like folly, or if it were lawful for us to conceive any action of Gods, which, compared with his deeper Contrivances, might have a ſhew of fooliſhneſs, yet even this were wiſer than the greateſt wiſdom of man: Angels are wiſer than
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64652:39"/> Men. When the Woman would ſpeak <hi>David</hi> to be very wiſe, above the rate of Mortals, ſhe ſaith, <hi>My Lord is wiſe as an Angel of God,</hi> 2 Sam. 14.20. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of their Natures ſpeaks the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of their Wiſdom, for it's the Underſtanding that is the chief diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing faculty. But are Angels like God in Wiſdom? No, they are Fools to him: <hi>Behold, he putteth no trust in his Servants, he chargeth his Angels with folly,</hi> Job 4.18. Though they never thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Divine pleaſure, nor in any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on manifeſted the leaſt imprudence; yet before him they are indicted of folly, and to him will be proved guilty of it. Though they are not chargeable with actual, yet they are with potential folly; though God doth not indict them of abſolute, yet he doth of comparative folly.</p>
               <p>God doth ſo far exceed Angels and Men in Wiſdom, That he is ſaid onely to be wiſe: <hi>To the onely wiſe God,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.17. <hi>To God onely wiſe,</hi> Rom. 16.27. None are wiſe beſide him, becauſe none are wiſe to him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.20. Wiſdom is his, his Peculiar, his Prerogative, his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64652:40"/> wholly, his onely; ſo his, that 'tis none's but his.</p>
               <p>The wiſeſt Men and Angels ſtand in need of a Maſter to teach them, and a Tutor to inſtruct them; and were it not for the onely wiſe God, they would be as unwiſe <hi>as the wild Aſſes Colt,</hi> as fooliſh as Idiots, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.10. But God is above all Teachers, all Tutors: Job 21.22. <hi>Shall any teach God knowledge.</hi> Some perſons are uncapable of teaching, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their extreme weakneſs; <hi>Ex quoris ligno non fit Mercurius,</hi> their parts are ſo very low and mean, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taught. But God is uncapable of teaching, becauſe of his immenſe Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: His abilities are ſo high, that they are above and beyond all inſtruction: Iſa. 40.13, 14. <hi>Who hath directed the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord, or being his Counſellor hath taught him?</hi> The wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> had his <hi>Privy-Counſellors;</hi> the wiſeſt Princes and States have their <hi>Council-Tables,</hi> and there is reaſon enough for it, becauſe two Heads are better then one (as we ſay) and two Eyes ſee more then one: <hi>Two are better then one,</hi> Eccleſ. 4.9. And <hi>in many Counſellors there is ſafety.</hi> But God who
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64652:40"/> is all Head, all Eye, all Underſtanding, needs none to adviſe or counſel him. Two Candles indeed are better then one, becauſe the light of each is little and ſmall, and capable of increaſe; but one Sun is better then a million of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, becauſe its light is (after a ſort) boundleſs, and uncapable of the leaſt addition, or increaſe by millions of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles: Verſe 14. <hi>With whom took he Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell?</hi> (with what Angel, with what Man, with what Politician did he ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult,) <hi>who instructed him in the Paths of Judgment?</hi> (taught him what was juſt, what was unjuſt, what to do, what to forbear; how to govern and order the Affairs of the World, in what manner and meaſure to cut out and carve every ones portion.) <hi>Who taught him knowledge, and ſhewed him the way of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding?</hi> Where is the Creature that can ſay, He obliged God, by giving him directions in any caſe? Where is the Man, the Angel, that can ſpeak it, that he ever taught God one Leſſon, or told him one Letter? If any ſuch be, God will pay him well for his Learning: Rom. 11.34, 35. <hi>Who hath known the mind of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64652:41"/> Lord, or who hath been his Counſellor? Who hath given to him, and it ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced to him again?</hi> We may know the mind of God for our inſtruction, but we can never know the mind of God for his inſtruction, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. God is incomparable in his <hi>Power:</hi> Power is that ability or force by which we act; Power in God is that Attribute by which he effecteth whatſoever he pleaſeth. In this he hath no equal; <hi>Who is a ſtrong God like unto thee?</hi> Pſal. 89.8. Where is the Being that is like him in ſtrength? God is not onely ſtrong, but <hi>mighty in ſtrength.</hi> Job 9.4. Not onely powerful, but <hi>excellent in Power,</hi> Job 37.23. <hi>Job</hi> hath a notable expreſſion, <hi>Job</hi> 9.19. <hi>If I ſpeak of ſtrength, loe he is ſtrong,</hi> i. e. As 'tis ordinary with us, when we would lift a man up to the height of praiſe for any quality in him, to ſay, <hi>If you ſpeak of Wealth, there's a rich man. If you ſpeak of Learning, there is a Schollar for you:</hi> So here ſaith <hi>Job, If I ſpeak of Strength, loe he is ſtrong.</hi> If I ſpeak of ſtrength and ability to contend and fight, loe, behold, wonder; here is one that is ſtrong indeed, that never
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64652:41"/> contendeth, but he prevaileth; who never Combats, but he Conquers: <hi>He is ſtrong</hi> indeed, <hi>He is ſtrong</hi> to purpoſe, with effect. He can <hi>offend,</hi> and there is no ſtanding before him; Dan. 4.35. <hi>He doth whatſoever he will, and none can ſtay his Hand.</hi> He can ſtop the motion of the ſtrongeſt Creature in its fulleſt ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt career, but none can ſtop or ſtay him in his Actions. Many have preſumption enough to oppoſe him, but none have Power enough to overcome him. He can <hi>defend,</hi> and there is no ſtriving with him; Iſa. 43.2. <hi>When thou paſſest through the Waters</hi> (be they never ſo boiſtrous, ſo tempeſtuous, ſo deep, ſo dangerous,) <hi>I will be with thee, and they ſhall not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow thee.</hi> The Floods of the ungodly may be very fierce and violent, but they ſhall never over-flow, or over-come, thoſe whom God is pleaſed to protect. It muſt be a ſtrange and ſtrong Arrow that can pierce ſuch a Sheild, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. of defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>God hath ſpoken once, yea twice have I heard thee,</hi> Pſal. 62.11. (It was ſome ſpecial extraordinary thing certainly that <hi>David</hi> uſhers in, with ſuch
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64652:42"/> a Preface, that God ſpake ſo ſolemnly, and he heard ſo attentively. But what was it?) <hi>That Power belongeth to God,</hi> as his proper peculiar Excellency, as his Crown and Scepter.</p>
               <p>God is not onely Mighty, but <hi>Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> Not only <hi>the Mighty God,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. but the <hi>Almighty God,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.18. He is a God that never met with a Difficulty, much leſs with an Impoſſibility: Nothing is too hard for God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.14. All things are hard to Men, and many things too hard for Men or Angels, but nothing is too hard for God: <hi>I know that thou canst do all things,</hi> Job 42.2.</p>
               <p>Men are ſtrong, they may have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtrength as Men, a civil ſtrength as Magiſtrates; they may be too ſtrong in themſelves for other perſons, and too ſtrong in their Armies and Militia's for other Kingdoms and Countries; but are they ſtrong enough for God? ſurely No, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25. <hi>The weakneſs of God is ſtronger then Man; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi Deus virtutem ſuam occultando infirmiter agere videtur, robuſtior tamen illa quae putatur imbecilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, quares hominum virtute,</hi> Calv. in Corinth. Not that there is any weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64652:42"/> in God, (for ſhould any think ſo, he ungods him,) but in thoſe Actions wherein God is pleaſed to conceal his Power, and ſeemeth to act infirmly; even that ſeeming infirmity excells all Humane power and ſtrength. Hence it is, that God throweth down the Gant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let to <hi>Job,</hi> Job 40.9. <hi>Hast thou an Arm like God.</hi> (By Arm, is meant Power and Strength, becauſe the Arm is that member of Man by which he exerteth and exerciſeth that power and ſtrength which he hath, ſo <hi>Job</hi> 35.9.) <hi>i. e. Job,</hi> though thou haſt had a ſtrong natural Arm, and a ſtrong civil Arm, <hi>as the greatest man in the East,</hi> and <hi>a King in the Army,</hi> Job 1.3. <hi>Job</hi> 29.25. Yet <hi>haſt thou an Arm like God;</hi> Canſt thou make and unmake, kill and make alive, caſt down and lift up at thy pleaſure, as I do? Is thine Arm as long to reach all thine Enemies, and as ſtrong to break and bruiſe them in pieces with a blow; <hi>Haſt thou an Arm like God?</hi> Canſt thou bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh and wield a Sword with thine Arm to the terror and horror, to the confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and deſtruction of all that oppoſe thee? <hi>God hath a mighty Arm, ſtrong is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64652:43"/> his Hand, high is his right Hand,</hi> Pſal. 89.13.</p>
               <p>Angels are ſtronger then Men: The evil Angel is call'd <hi>The ſtrong man,</hi> Luke 11.21. They are ſtiled <hi>Principalities and Powers,</hi> Epheſ. 6.12. <hi>Roaring Lyons,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8. <hi>Red Dragons,</hi> Rev. 12.9. which denote their Power to be far ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to Mans. The Devil is the <hi>Prince of the Powers of the Air,</hi> Epheſ. 2.2. Can command Storms and Tempeſts, and with a puff of his mouth blow down Houſes and Cities. Good Angels (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably) are ſtronger, one of them in a night deſtroyeth 184000 men. They are ſo ſtrong, that they are ſaid <hi>to excel in ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 103.20. And indeed, the ſpirituality and purity of their natures ſpeaks their Power. Man's weakneſs is partly from his Fleſh, which is a phraſe whereby the Prophet deſcribes the impotency of the Creature: <hi>They are Men, and their Horſes are Fleſh, and not Spirit,</hi> Iſa. 31.3. (And when the Holy Ghoſt would deſcribe the ſtrength of a thing, he oppoſeth it to Fleſh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. Our Weapons are not <hi>fleſhly or carnal,</hi> but <hi>mighty,</hi>) partly from his moral filthineſs,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64652:43"/> his ſin, which being a real Diſeaſe, doth debilitate and weaken the powers of man: Hence to be a Sinner, and to be without ſtrength, is all one, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6, 8. and Holineſs is called <hi>The ſtrength of man,</hi> Rev. 3.8. But Angels are Spirits, not Fleſh; <hi>He maketh his Angels Spirits,</hi> Pſal. 104.4. And good Angels are free from ſin, therefore called <hi>holy Angels,</hi> Mark 8.38. Yet notwithſtanding all their Power as Spirits, as ſinleſs Spirits, they are weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God. As 'tis ſaid of Leviathan,<note place="margin">Job 41.27.</note> 
                  <hi>He eſteemeth Iron as Straw, and Braſs as rotten Wood.</hi> So I may ſay of God, He eſteemeth the ſtrength of evil Angels as Straw, and of good Angels as rotten Wood. Evil Angels are fettered, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they go, in the Chains of his Anger and his Power, which they cannot break aſunder, but muſt bear as intollerable as they are. And good Angels own and acknowledge his might and ſtrength above all other, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.8, 11. The Power of God hath no Fellow, no Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel. <hi>There is no Rock (i. e.</hi> no ſtrength, Rocks being ſtrong natural Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Vide</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Judges</hi> 6.16.) <hi>like our God,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.2.</p>

And rendereth to every man according to his works, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.12. <hi>Job</hi> 34.11, 19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6, 7. God is poſitively or affirmatively juſt; Eph. 3.5. <hi>The just Lord is in the midst thereof, he will not do iniquity.</hi> He is eminently the <hi>just One,</hi> Acts 7.52.

He is moſt juſt, juſt in the higheſt degree, juſt beyond all degrees. He giveth to all their due, without fear of evil, (He ſtandeth in awe of none for their power or greatneſs, His day of Vengeance is <hi>againſt the Cedars of</hi> Lebanon, <hi>and the Oakes of</hi> Baſhan, <hi>and all the high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> Iſa. 2, 13, 14.) without hope of gain, (men are unjuſt for Bribes, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.14. and love with <hi>ſhame give ye;</hi> but

                  <hi>Riches prevail not in the day of his Wrath,</hi> Prov. 11.4. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7, 19. He is no taker of Gifts, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.7.) and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to any, for their nearneſs or relation to him, or Honors, or outward Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies; <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.24. He will pluck the <hi>Signet from his right hand</hi> in the day of his Juſtice: <hi>Iſrael</hi> were a People <hi>near to him,</hi> Deut. 4.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. <hi>ult.</hi> Yet he doth not ſpare them, when they rebel againſt him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.1, 2, 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.10. to 15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.12. Read the <hi>Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and you will find his ſeverity to them, notwithſtanding their near relation to him. <hi>Adam</hi> and Angels were great &amp; excellent Beings, yet when they ſinned, he made them to ſuffer: <hi>He accepteth not the Perſons of Princes, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth the Rich more then the Poor,</hi> Job 34.19. He acteth according to Law moſt exactly, and according to a Law publiſhed, and according to a moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and juſt Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12, 13, 15, 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. therefore is moſt juſt: <hi>Surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert Judgment,</hi> Job 34.12. Surely the Almighty cannot do wickedly, neither can God pervert
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64652:45"/> Judgment: Men <hi>may</hi> do juſtly, God <hi>muſt</hi> do juſtly, he cannot but do juſtly; and that becauſe his Will is his Law, and the moſt exact Plat-form and Rule of all Juſtice and Righteouſneſs. Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he doth is juſt, becauſe he doth it who is the great Soveraign and Supreme of the World, <hi>Job</hi> 34.12, 13.</p>
               <p>The Actions of God are often <hi>myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> but ever <hi>righteous; Pſal.</hi> 145.17. <hi>The Lord is holy in all his Wayes, and righteous in all his Works;</hi> When his <hi>Pathes</hi> are <hi>in the Seas,</hi> and <hi>his goings in deep Waters,</hi> Pſal. 77.19. That none can fathom them, or find out the reaſon of them, even then all his wayes are <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Deut. 32.4. Not as Judgment is oppoſed to Mercy, but as Judgment is oppoſed to injuſtice. When <hi>Clouds and Darkneſs are before him, (i. e.</hi> when his Providences are ſuch hard Texts, that none can expound them; and ſuch dark Riddles, that none can unfold them, even then) <hi>Righteouſneſs and Judgment are the habitation of his Throne,</hi> Pſal. 99.2. His diſpoſing and diſtributive Power moves alwayes within the Sphere of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:64652:45"/>
               <p>Men may be juſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a juſt man; <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 6.9. <hi>John,</hi> Mark 6.20. <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Acts 10.22. <hi>But ſhall mortal man be more juſt then God? ſhall man be more pure then his Maker,</hi> Job 4.17. The Expreſſion is a denial of all compariſon between God and Man: It's the higheſt preſumption for Man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf before God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.13, 14. Yea, it's monſtrous impudency for Man to compare himſelf with God. We ſay amongſt men, That compariſons are odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but this is the moſt odious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of all, for <hi>Enoſh,</hi> a weak frail Creature, to compare with <hi>Elchah,</hi> the Mighty, Almighty Creator; for crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs to compare with ſtraitneſs, and Darkneſs to compare with Light: The moſt juſt man compared with God, is unjuſt; His Righteouſneſs is as a filthy rag: <hi>In his ſight can no Fleſh be justified,</hi> Pſal. 143.2. Though in the ſight of men, a man may be juſt, yet in the ſight of God he is unjuſt: Compare a Star with a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and 'tis ſomewhat; but compare it with the Sun, and 'tis nothing; it muſt hide its head for ſhame. Compare a godly man with a wicked man, or one
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64652:46"/> not ſo good as himſelf, and he is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body; but compare him with an Angel, he is no body: what is he then, if he be compared with a God? Job 9.2, 3. <hi>How ſhould man be just with God?</hi> (ſpeak the way, declare the means, the manner, how man ſhould be righteous before God,) <hi>If he will contend with him, he cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand;</hi> Not to one Queſtion of a thouſand which God can put to him, not for one Action of a thouſand which himſelf hath wrought. Alas, is he juſt, who is ſo far from ability to juſtifie all he doth, that he cannot juſtifie one act of a thouſand that he doth.</p>
               <p>Angels are juſt, they are righteous in their natures, have no ſpot; in their lives have no Error, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20. But are they righteous to God, or before God? No, <hi>Job</hi> 4.16, 17, 18. Angels are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in juſtice to God; though they are juſt to Man, they are unjuſt to God: They are in a poſſibility (conſidered in themſelves) of actual injuſtice, which God is not; he is incapable of being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. Again, the Law or Rule of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Righteouſneſs is without them, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64652:46"/> dictinct from them, (and thereby they are the more capable of ſwerving from it) but the Law or Rule of Gods Juſtice is within him; yea, 'tis himſelf, he is his own Law, his own Rule, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis impoſſible for him to recede, or err from it. When the Workman and his Rule are different, there may be fear of wandring from his Rule; for though the Rule be ſtrait, yet the Man may, through the miſtake of his Eye, or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his Hand, draw a crooked Line; but when the Workman and his Rule are the ſame, there is no fear: God's Will that acteth all things, is the Rule by which he acteth; and therefore every Line muſt be ſtrait, and every Action juſt. He can never err in any thing he doth, whoſe Will is the Rule of all he doth; nay, whoſe Actions are their own Rule. Such is the Creatures weakneſs, that he may wander out of his way; but ſuch is the Creators Power and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he cannot poſſibly wander, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is his own way; <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.35. <hi>I</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>bleſſed the moſt High, who doth according to his Will in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64652:47"/> the Earth.</hi> Obſerve, who doth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Will, that is his eſſential eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rule: God doth ſo much ſurpaſs Men and Angels in Juſtice, that he is ſaid to be the <hi>Habitation of Juſtice;</hi> Jer. 50.7. <hi>They have ſinned against the Lord, the Habitation of Juſtice;</hi> as if Juſtice dwelt no where, had no abode but in him and with him.</p>

Angels are more knowing then Men: Fleſh is dull-ſighted, and of dim underſtanding; Spirits have ſharper Wits, and quicker
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64652:48"/> Apprehenſions. The Devil, though a fallen Angel, hath one of his names <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> from his Knowledge: Elect Angels ſurely know much more then Devils, for they alwayes <hi>Behold the Face of their Father,</hi> and in that Face, as in a Glaſs, behold more then humane Eyes can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, or evil Angels conceive. The Spirits of juſt Men in Heaven <hi>ſee Face to Face, and know as they are known,</hi> underſtand very much more then they could here below; but Angels, as their Underſtandings are of larger capacity, and their Natures more excellent, muſt needs know more then Men: But do Men or Angels know as God; Can it be ſaid of any Man, of any Angel, <hi>He is perfect in Knowledge:</hi> His Knowledge is uncapable of addition or diminution. Can it be ſaid of any Man, any Angel, his Knowledge <hi>is infinite.</hi> Man's knowledge in this World is little, in compariſon of what it ſhall be; yea, nothing: We are but of Yeſterday, and know nothing, <hi>Job</hi> 8.3. He is but of ſmall continuance here, and hath but little experience; and therefore muſt have but little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yea ſo little, that it's call'd
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64652:48"/> nothing: yea, the knowledge of Men and Angels in the other World will be ſo little (though enough for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and ſatisfaction) that it will be nothing, in compariſon of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God; finite knowledge is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, compared with that knowledge which is infinite.</p>
               <p>Whether you conſider the matter or object of God's Knowledge, or the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or way of it, he is incomparable in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you conſider the <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of his Knowledge: God knoweth all things; John 21 17. <hi>Lord thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt all things:</hi> 1 John 3.20. <hi>God is greater then our Hearts, for he knoweth all things.</hi> He knoweth whatſoever hath been, whatſoever is, whatſoever ſhall be, whatſoever can be, whatſoever cannot be. He knoweth all ſubſtances, acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, neceſſary contingent things: He makes all, upholds all, governs all, and diſcerneth all: The Eyes of the Lord are in every place, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.3.</p>
               <p>He knoweth thoſe things that are moſt <hi>hidden,</hi> moſt ſecret, the Hearts, the Thoughts, the moſt cloſe retired mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64652:49"/> of the Spirit of Man; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>What man knoweth the things of a man, but the ſpirit of a man that is in him?</hi> Yea, what Angel knoweth the things of a man? but God doth. <hi>Hell and Deſtruction are before the Lord; how much more the hearts of the Children of Men,</hi> Prov. 15.11. Hell ſeems to be far from his ſight, and very remote from Heaven his Seat: The hearts of the Children of men ſeem to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable, ſo deep that none can fathom them; but he hath a Line that will ſound theſe depths: He knoweth the ſpirit of man, better then man knoweth himſelf: <hi>The heart is deceitful, and deſperately wicked, who knoweth it?</hi> (No Man, no Angel knoweth it,) <hi>I the Lord ſearch the Heart,</hi> Jer. 17.9, 10. And none knoweth it but he, therefore he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable herein; <hi>For thou, thou only knoweſt the Hearts of the Children of Men,</hi> 1 Kings 8.39. It's his ſole Prerogative: Men and Angels may ſee the Skins and Colours, and Lineaments and Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Faces and Garments, or out-ſides of things; but God ſeeth the in-ſides, he pryeth into the very bowels of things, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7. All things are naked and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64652:49"/> diſſected and anatomized before him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.20.</p>
               <p>He knoweth what is future, as well as what is paſt and preſent: <hi>Thou knowest my Thoughts afar off,</hi> Pſal. 139.2. Long before I think them: They? are in thy Thoughts, before they are in my Heart. Man knoweth not what a day is big with, or may bring forth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.1. nor Angels neither; but God knoweth what is in the Womb of eternity, what all Ages and Generations ſhall produce: <hi>He declares the end from the beginning, and from ancient time the things that are not yet done,</hi> Iſa. 46.10. And tells us this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to himſelf, <hi>Let them declare the things that ſhall come to paſs, that we may know that they are gods,</hi> Iſa. 41.23. Let them fore-tell what is future, and we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their Deity. Predictions are <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana Imperii,</hi> thoſe ſecret things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long onely to God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.22, 23, 26.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is incomparable in the <hi>manner</hi> of his Knowledge: God knoweth all things <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>perfectly,</hi> Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels know (what they do know) but
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64652:50"/> imperfectly, and by halves: They know but part of what is knowable, and they know this but in part. God beholds every thing throughly, as if (like a well-drawn Picture) he beheld that alone, and none but that, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9. <hi>His Eye-lids try the Children of Men,</hi> Pſal. 11.5. <hi>i. e.</hi> He hath a diſtinct cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain critical through knowledge of them.</p>
               <p>God knoweth all things <hi>immediately,</hi> by immediate intuition, not by ſpecies: Men know things either by the Senſes, the Eyes, Ears, or Taſtes; or by ſpecies taken in by the Senſe, and imprinted on the phantaſie, which are thence offered to the Underſtanding; or elſe by Faith, and the report of others, or by diſcourſe and ratiocination. He knoweth one thing by another, the Concluſion by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums and Premiſes; the Cauſes by the Effects, and the Conſequents by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents. Saints and Angels in Heaven know things in God, not in themſelves: God knoweth all things in themſelves, and ſeeth all things in himſelf, as in a Glaſs, Man in this World muſt have a two-fold Light to ſee by; A light in his
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64652:50"/> Eye, and a light in the Air: But the Father of Lights needs no light to ſee by, <hi>Darkneſs and Light are both alike to him,</hi> Pſal. 139.12. His Eyes are as a <hi>Flame of Fire,</hi> He ſeeth in the Dark, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.14.</p>
               <p>God knoweth all things <hi>at once (uno actu &amp; uno ictu,</hi> as they ſay): Creatures know one thing by another, and one thing after another; Their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are unable to take in many Objects at once, much leſs able to take in all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects at once; but God ſeeth all things at one View: <hi>The Lord looketh down from Heaven, he beholdeth all the Children of Men's From the place of his Habitation he beholdeth all the Inhabitants of the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 33.13, 14. The Eye of Man may ſee many things at once, as an Hive of Bees, but if it will ſee other things, it muſt remove the ſight; though the Mind of Man can take in more then the Eye, as a whole Country or World at once, yet 'tis onely the lumpe of groſs; if it would take the diſtinct knowledge of them, it muſt remove from thought to thought; but God takes all diſtinctly particularly at once.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:64652:51"/>
               <p>God knoweth all things <hi>from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,</hi> before ever the World had a Being: Men and Angels may know what is, when it is, but cannot know it as God doth, before it was; Acts 15.18. <hi>Known to God are all his Works, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World.</hi> Before he erected the curious frame of the World, he knew all the Rooms and Furniture in it, all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and actions of all the Inhabitants of it. He doth by one pure, ſimple, undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, eternal act of his Underſtanding know all things perfectly, immediately, diſtinctly, every moment.</p>
               <p n="6">6. God is incomparable in his <hi>Truth and Faithfulneſs:</hi> Truth is that Attribute in God, whereby he is in himſelf, as he reveals himſelf to be, and in his ſayings and doings, as he ſpeaketh and acteth.</p>
               <p>God is Truth <hi>in himſelf,</hi> and Truth towards his Creatures: He is Truth in himſelf, 1. As he truly is, and really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſteth: Hence he is ſtiled the <hi>true God, Jer</hi> 10.10. <hi>John</hi> 17.3. in oppoſition to Idols, or falſe gods, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.9. So he is truly infinite, truly all-ſufficient, truly eternal, truly immutable, &amp;c. 2. As he is the unchangeable Archetipe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64652:51"/> and Idaea of all true things without him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo all created things are true, as they anſwer their patterns in his mind. 3. In his immanent Actions, as his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and eternal Reſolutions, are all certain, and attain a punctual accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.11. He is never deceived nor diſappointed in his Purpoſes.</p>
               <p>God is Truth <hi>towards his Creatures;</hi> 1. In his <hi>Works,</hi> as all his Actions of Creation, Preſervation, Government, Redemption, are real, and not chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's or appearances, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In his <hi>Words,</hi> all he ſaith is Truth: His <hi>Precepts</hi> are true, a perfect Rule of holineſs, without any defect, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.86. <hi>All thy Commandements are Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi> verſe 142. <hi>Thy Law is the Truth.</hi> All his <hi>Promiſes</hi> are true, and ſhall be performed: <hi>Not one good thing faileth of all that the Lord our God hath promiſed,</hi> Joſh. 23.14.

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> God incomparable in his Mercy and Patience.</head>
               <p n="7">7. GOD is incomparable in his <hi>Mercy:</hi> Mercy is an Attribute of God, whereby he pittieth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth his Creature in miſery. It's an Attribute which relateth to the <hi>Creature</hi> onely; God knoweth himſelf, and loveth himſelf, and glorifieth himſelf; but he is not merciful to himſelf: It is an Attribute that relateth to the Creature <hi>in miſery.</hi> Juſtice ſeeks a <hi>worthy</hi> Object, Grace is exerciſed towards an unworthy Object, but Mercy looks out for a <hi>needy,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent Object. God is bountiful and gracious to Elect Angels, becauſe they could not deſerve that perfection and happineſs which they enjoy; but he is not merciful to them, for they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver miſerable. Fallen Man is the proper Object of Mercy, as being not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving of the leaſt good, but as alſo having plunged himſelf into all evil. Mercy is an Attribute, whereby he <hi>pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:64652:53"/> his Creature in miſery: Hence he is ſaid in Scripture (after the manner of Men) to have <hi>tender Mercies,</hi> Pſal. 25.6. And <hi>bowels of Mercy,</hi> Luke 1.58. And to be <hi>afflicted in the Afflictions</hi> of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9. And to have his <hi>Soul grieved for the miſeries of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Judges</hi> 10.15, 16. As tender Parents, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely troubled for the Afflictions of their Children, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.12, 13. So his <hi>Bowels are turned within him, his Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are kindled together,</hi> Hoſ. 11.8, 9. Mercy doth not onely pity, but alſo <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> the afflicted; it hath an Hand to ſupply, as well as an Heart to pity thoſe that are in Diſtreſs, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 34.18. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.16.</p>
               <p>The Attribute of Mercy is that which God glorieth in, and boaſteth of, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.8. Noble and Heroick Spirits are ever gentle and merciful: The baſeſt Minds are moſt cruel, and fartheſt from Mercy. God ſaith, <hi>Fury is not in him,</hi> Iſaiah 27.4. Judgment is his <hi>ſtrange Work,</hi> Iſaiah 28.21. <hi>He doth not afflict willingly,</hi> Lament. 3.33. <hi>But delighteth in the Proſperity of his Servants,</hi> Pſalm 35.27. It's not his Nature to diſturb and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64652:54"/> deſtroy Men, it's their Sin that forceth Thunderbolts into his Hands, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 44.22. His delight is in Mercy, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.18. The bleſſed God hath <hi>multitude of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> Pſal. 51.1. To anſwer the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Creatures Miſeries, <hi>Abundant mercy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. He is ſaid to be <hi>rich in mercy,</hi> Epheſ. 2.4. <hi>Exceeding abundant rich in mercy,</hi> Epheſ. 2.7. His Mercy, as Oyl, ſwims on the top of all his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, is his delight, Jer. 32.41. <hi>I will rejoyce over them, to do them good.</hi> His Mercy, as Gold, being moſt excellent, over-layeth all his Works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.7. <hi>His tender mercy is over all his Works.</hi> His Mercy is to all admiration: <hi>O how excellent is thy loving kindneſs,</hi> Pſal. 36.7. <hi>O how great is thy goodneſs,</hi> Pſal. 31.19. His Mercy is beyond all Apprehenſion; Thy Mercy reacheth to the Heavens, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. He is ſtiled <hi>the Father of Mercies,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.3. Not the Father of Juſtice or Fury.</p>
               <p>Mercy is the Joy and Pleaſure of God: Hence he is ſaid to have a Mercy-Seat, and to have a Throne of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.5. Sitting is a poſture of Eaſe and Reſt, but he riſeth to execute Juſtice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.1.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64652:54"/> He doth reſt in his Love, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. Mercy is the Glory and Honour of God. When <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee the Glory of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.18. The Lord proclaims, <hi>The Lord God gracious, merciful,</hi> Exod. 34.6, 7. When God promiſeth to do great things for his People, That he will give them Health, abundance of Peace, cleanſe them from all their Filthineſs, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all their Iniquities, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.7, 8, 9. He gives us the fruit of it, verſe 9. <hi>And it ſhall be to me for a Name of Joy, a Praiſe and Glory before all Nations.</hi> His Mercy is his Riches, his Treaſure; Hence he is ſaid to be <hi>Rich in mercy,</hi> Eph. 2.4.</p>
               <p>God is merciful in all he doth, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally merciful: <hi>All his wayes are Mercy and Truth,</hi> Pſal. 25.10. The whole World is a Volume written within and without with Characters of Mercy. He is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to all Men; Pſal. 145.9. <hi>Sheweth mercy to thouſands, Exod.</hi> 20.6. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. <hi>Math.</hi> 5.45, 46. He is merciful at all times. His mercy endureth for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.1, 2, 3. He is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all reſpects; He giveth all ſorts of Mercies, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:64652:55"/>
               <p>Men are merciful, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.26. So are Angels in a ſenſe; but none of them comparable to God: The tender Mercies of the Wicked, yea of the righteous Men, yea of Angels, are Cruelties to the Mercies of God. Have they ſuch Pity, ſuch Bowels for miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures as God hath? Have they ſuch Power, ſuch Ability, to relieve af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Ones as God hath? Can they afford preſerving, protecting Mercy, as God, <hi>Job</hi> 10.12. Pardoning and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Mercy, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.18. Purifying and renewing Mercy, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.4. Saving and eternal Mercy, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6. O how infinitely ſhort do they come of him. He is ſo incomparable in Mercy, that Mercy is ſaid to belong onely to him: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee, O Lord, belongeth Mercy,</hi> Pſal. 62.10. Unto thee, and none but thee. He is ſo merciful, that when his Bowels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with juſtice on the behalf of Sinners, and get the upper hand, he rejoyceth in the Victory; Mercy rejoyceth againſt Judgment, <hi>James</hi> 2.14. He is ſo merciful, that he diſpenſeth with his own Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the ſake of it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Math.</hi> 9.13. with <hi>Math.</hi> 12.7. Once more, he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64652:55"/> is ſo merciful, that he is upbraided with it, as if he were too fond of that Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and loved it over-much, Jonah 4.2. <hi>Was not this my ſaying in my own Country? for I knew that thou waſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> Thou didſt ſend me to Preach De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Deſolation to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> but when I received the Meſſage, I knew all would be prevented by mercy, and that to Preach ſuch a Threatning, was but to diſgrace and diſhonor my ſelf, as a falſe Prophet, before the men of <hi>Nineveh;</hi> for I thought then, what is now come to paſs, that notwithſtanding the peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torineſs of the Meſſage, Mercy would interpoſe, and prove me falſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. God is incomparable in his <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> Patience is that Attribute in God, whereby he beareth with Sinners, and forbears or defers their Puniſhment; or that, whereby he expecteth and waiteth long for their Converſion. He is a God <hi>ſlow to anger,</hi> Pſal. 103.8. He waiteth on Men to do them good, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. He is <hi>long-ſuffering,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.7, 9. Nay, <hi>He endureth with much long-ſuffering the Veſſels of Wrath,</hi> Rom. 9.22. He is the <hi>God of Patience,</hi> Rom. 15.5.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:64652:56"/>
               <p>The Patience of God is the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, if we conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How <hi>perfectly he hateth Sin, Pſal.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.16. And how offenſive it is to him, it grieveth him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. It preſſeth him as Sheaves preſs a Cart, <hi>Amos</hi> 2.13. He is broken with their whoriſh Hearts, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.9.

               <p>Men are Patient: <hi>Moſes</hi> was the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man on Earth, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.12. But
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64652:57"/> could he bear as God?

If God ſhould be as impatient towards the moſt patient Men, as they are towards others, woe would be to them that ever they were born.</p>
               <p>But though Men come ſhort; yet, are not Angels as patient as God?

God gives them the reaſon why he declines their immediate Conduct, leaſt their ſtubbornneſs ſhould provoke him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them; yet they weep and mourn at theſe tydings. Alas, they knew if God could not bear with their Provocations, much leſs could Angels; and therefore if Angels be their Guides, they muſt periſh. If they could tire out infinite forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and drain an Ocean; they muſt needs quickly tire out finite Patience, and drain a little Stream: How ſoon would limited forbearance, and a drop of patience be ſpent.

               <p n="2">2. I Shall ſhew more ſpecially the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between God and his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in reference to theſe communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Attributes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe Attributes are all <hi>eſſential to</hi> God: They are from God, as well as in God. He is their <hi>Author,</hi> as well as their <hi>Subject:</hi> But in Men and Angels they are all derivative; though Truth, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Holineſs, may be in them, yet they are not from them, but from God. God is not obliged to any but himſelf for them; He can thank onely himſelf that he hath them, but Angels and Men are not obliged to themſelves, but to him for them. When the high God would lay <hi>Job</hi> low, by manifeſting the vaſt difference between himſelf and <hi>Job;</hi> He bids <hi>Job</hi> be obliged to himſelf for his Excellency,<note place="margin">Job 40.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Deck thy ſelf with Majesty
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64652:59"/> and Excellency, array thy ſelf with Glory and Beauty.</hi> To be deckt and array'd with Majeſty and Excellency, notes, 1. The extent and abundance of it, the whole man is cover'd with Rayment. To be cloath'd with ſhame, is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely reproached, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.26. To be arrayed with humility, is to be very hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, lowly in an extraordinary degree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5.2. The publikeneſs of it; our Deckings and Rayments are viſible, we cannot go abroad, but all ſee our Clothes. God ſpeaks to <hi>Job</hi> to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Job, thou hast talk'd very preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly, and carried thy ſelf as if there were no great diſtance or difference between Me and thy ſelf, as if thou wert like me, and and equal to me: If thou art, let me ſee it; Deck thy ſelf with Majeſty and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, array thy ſelf with Glory and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I can deck my ſelf, and array my ſelf with all theſe in the highest degree, and will not be beholden to any others for their help: I am clothed with Majesty, but no Creature lent an hand for the making up, or puting on thoſe Clothes.</hi> Pſal. 104.1. <hi>I have cover'd my ſelf with light as with a Garment,</hi> Pſal. 104.2. <hi>But neither Man
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64652:59"/> nor Angel aſſorded me the least aſſistance therein. Do thou as much for thy ſelf as I have done for my ſelf, and then indeed thou mayſt compare with me.</hi> God might make the ſame offer to Angels which he doth to <hi>Job,</hi> and none of them would or could accept it. Dependance is of their eſſence, as they are Creatures; and they can no more be ſeparated from it, then from themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe Attributes are the <hi>very eſſence of God;</hi> not Qualities or Properties, as in Men and Angels. The holineſs of God is the <hi>holy God: Once have I ſworn by my Holineſs,</hi> Pſal. 89.36. (<hi>i. e.</hi> by my ſelf,) <hi>that I will not lye unto</hi> David. For <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.13. God <hi>having no greater to ſwear by, ſwore by himſelf.</hi> The Power of God is the powerful God, the Truth of God is the true God, the Wiſdom of God is the wiſe God. All his Attributes are himſelf, his Eſſence: In Men and Angels, their Wiſdom, and Power, and Juſtice, and Truth, are Accidents, and differ from their Subſtances; and this is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, becauſe Angels and Men may be, and are, without theſe Attributes, as Devils and wicked Men. In them theſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64652:60"/> Properties are one thing, and their Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is another thing, ſo that they may be ſeparated. An Angel may be an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and not holy, nor wiſe, nor juſt, &amp;c. A Man may be a Man, and not powerful, nor patient, nor merciful; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe theſe Properties are really diſtinct from the Eſſences of Men or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; but in God they are his very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Eſſence; they are himſelf, and can no way be ſeparated from him, no more then he can be ſeparated from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: God could not be God, if he were not moſt wiſe, moſt holy, moſt juſt, moſt patient, &amp;c. God's Attributes are one moſt pure Eſſence diverſly apprehended of us, as it is diverſly manifeſted to us. God's puniſhing the Wicked, is his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; God's performing his Promiſes, is his Faithfulneſs: His relieving the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, is his Mercy: His bearing with the Guilty, is his Patience; ſo all are his Eſſence, himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe Attributes are <hi>all one</hi> in God: His Juſtice, is his Mercy; and his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, is his Patience, and his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is his Faithfulneſs; and his Mercy, is his Juſtice, &amp;c. Though they are
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64652:60"/> diſtinguiſhed, in regard of their <hi>Objects,</hi> and in regard of our <hi>Apprehenſions</hi> of them, and in regard of their <hi>Effects:</hi> yet they are all one in themſelves, and this floweth from the former head, becauſe they are the Eſſence of God, and his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is a pure undivided Being. In Men and Angels, theſe Attributes or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are different and ſeveral, for they may have one without the other: Their Righteouſneſs is one thing, and their Power another thing, and their Truth a third thing: For we ſee in Angels ſome that are ſtrong and powerful, that are not righteous or faithful; and among Men, ſome have one of theſe Perfections who have not another; yea, though in good men all theſe perfections are in ſome degree, yet all are not in any one in the ſame degree; there is ſcarce any Saint who is not more eminent for ſome ſpiritual excellency then for others. But in God they are all one and the ſame. As when the Sun-beams ſhine through a yellow Glaſs, they are yellow; a green Glaſs, they are green; a red Glaſs, they are red; and yet all the while the beames are the ſame: Or as when the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64652:61"/> Sun ſhines on Clay, it hardens it; on Wax, it ſoftneſs it; on ſweet Flowers, it draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out their fragrancy; on Dunghills and Ditches, it draweth out their ill ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: yet ſtill it's the ſame Sun, and the ſame Influences; the difference lyeth in the Objects and the Effects. So the great God, who is alwayes working in the World, when he worketh towards the Wicked in puniſhing, he is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; towards the Godly in ſaving them, he is merciful; yet ſtill the ſame immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All theſe Attributes are in God <hi>in the highest degree;</hi> yea, beyond all degrees: Theſe communicable Attributes which are in Angels and Men in degrees, and limited, (for a finite Subſtance will not admit of an infinite Property) are in God infinitely. Immenſity, like a golden Thread runs through all his communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Properties: <hi>His <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding is infinite,</hi> Pſal. 147.5. So his juſtice is infinite, his Mercy is infinite, and all the reſt: They have no bounds, no limits, but his own will and pleaſure. He never acted to the utmoſt in any of them; he never put forth ſo much Power, but he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64652:61"/> could put forth more if he pleaſed: He never exerciſed ſo much Patience, but he could exerciſe more if he would.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, That in Scripture that they are affirmed of God not onely in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, but alſo in the abſtract. He is not onely loving, but <hi>Love, God is love,</hi> 1 John 4.7. He is not onely wiſe, but <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> Prov. 9.1. <hi>Wiſdom hath built her Houſe:</hi> He is not onely good, but <hi>goodneſs; I will make all my goodneſs (i. e.</hi> my ſelf,) <hi>paſs before thee,</hi> Exod. 33.19. He is not onely holy, but holineſs: <hi>Look down from Heaven, the Habitation where thy holineſs dwelleth,</hi> Iſa. 63.15. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Attributes of God muſt be boundleſs, becauſe they are his Being himſelf.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, GOD is incomparable in his <hi>Works,</hi> as well as in his Being and Attributes: None hath ſuch a ſtrong Hand, ſuch a ſtretched out Arm, or can do like him. <hi>O Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) thou hast begun to ſhew to thy Servant thy Greatneſs, and thy mighty Hand: For what God is there in Heaven or on Earth, that can do according to thy Works?</hi> Deut. 3.24. He is a God <hi>doing Wonders,</hi> Exod. 15.11. His Doings are like his Being: He works like a God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.29. He is <hi>wonderful in Counſel, and excellent in working:</hi> His Works are all wonderful, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.10. <hi>Thou doſt marvellous things, thou art God alone.</hi> He doth <hi>miranda ſtupenda;</hi> ſo that it is ſaid of him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.23. <hi>What hath God wrought?</hi> His Works are <hi>great,</hi> Joel 2.21. <hi>Honourable and glorious,</hi> Pſal. 111.3. <hi>Perfect,</hi> Deut. 32.4. <hi>God thundereth marvellouſly with his Voice, great things doth he, which we cannot comprehend,</hi> Job
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64652:62"/> 37.5. The Works of Men and Angels are little, ſmall; ſome mean things they do by Divine concurrence; but his Works are great and unſearchable, which we cannot comprehend. If Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do great things, (in a ſenſe, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively,) yet they may be <hi>found out;</hi> their Fellow-Creatures have a Clue which will lead them into all their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinths, and a Line which will ſound the bottome of all their Actions; but God's Works cannot be comprehended by the underſtandings of any Creature: <hi>O the depth of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God; how unſearchable are his Wayes, and Doings paſt finding out,</hi> Rom. 11.33. <hi>His Foot-ſteps are not known,</hi> Pſal. 77.19. Yea, <hi>He doth great things, and unſearchable and marvellous things without number,</hi> Job 5.9. till there be no number. If Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures could do great things, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous and unſearchable; yet you might ſoon reckon up all ſuch works of theirs, one great marvellous unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing were enough for the whole Creation; But God doth <hi>great things and unſearchable, yea marvellous things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number.</hi> His wayes are not as Mans
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64652:63"/> wayes, <hi>as far as the Heavens are higher then the Earth,</hi> ſo far are his wayes above the wayes of man, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.8, 9. No wayes like his; <hi>Among all the Gods, there is none like unto him; neither are there any Works like unto his Works,</hi> Pſal. 86.8. Whether you conſider the matter of his Works, and the Works themſelves, or his manner of Working.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Works themſelves, and therein I ſhall (paſs by his internal Works, both perſonal and effectual, and) mention on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his external Works.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is incomparable in what Works <hi>he is pleaſed to do, or hath done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Creation,</hi> Herein he is incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: <hi>Creatura non poteſt creare,</hi> The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot create; <hi>Ex nihilo nihil fit</hi> with them: Man may do ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the emendation of the form, but he cannot produce matter, no nor mend it when 'tis before him. A <hi>Goldſmith</hi> may make a ſparkling Jewel, but then you muſt give him Gold and pretious Stones to make it of; he can put the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a better form, but he is ſo far from making matter where there is none, that he cannot mend the matter which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64652:63"/> you give him: He cannot make Gold of Silver, nor Diamonds of common Stones. Man's work may exceed the matter, but man's work cannot make the matter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed it ſelf. But God can not onely make the matter to exceed it ſelf, (as in man, who is formed of the Duſt of the Earth, he hath ſuch curious Parts, Veins, Sinews, Arteries, &amp;c. ſuch Members, Eyes, Cheeks, Ears, &amp;c. Such Characters of Beauty in the whole, that he looks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like his Parent Earth, the matter of which he was made,) but alſo make matter: He hath brought ſomething, nay all things out of nothing. All the Angels and Men cannot create one grain of Corn, one pile of Graſs, one mote of Duſt; but the great God hath erected the ſtately Fabrick of Heaven and the Earth, with the curious ſteps and ſtories thereof, and the various Creatures and Furniture therein, of nothing. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he proves himſelf the true God, <hi>The living God that made Heaven and Earth, &amp; all things therein,</hi> Act. 14.15. He proves his Deity hereby, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.10, 11, 12. <hi>The gods that have not made the Heavens and the Earth, ſhall periſh from the Earth, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64652:64"/> from under the Heavens: He hath made the Earth by his Power, He hath establiſhed the World by his Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>ſtretched out the Heavens by his diſcretion;</hi> i. e. Can you be ſo fooliſh and ſottiſh, as to imagine that blind, dumb, deaf, dead Idols can compare with him, who created you, and all things beſide. When God would proclaim his Soveraignty, and incomparable Excellency, he challengeth <hi>Job, Where waſt thou, when I laid the Foundations of the Earth? declare, if thou haſt understanding: Who hath laid the meaſures thereof, or ſtretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the Foundations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſet? or who laid the corner-ſtone there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?</hi> Job 38.4, 5. God would here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the exactneſs and acurateneſs of his Works, and ſo he alludes to men, who when they would ſet up a ſtrong, ſtately, neat, compact Dwelling, lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and corner Stones, and all the reſt by line and meaſure: But that which God would principally intimate here, is his own Omnipotency, and mans Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency: <hi>Where waſt thou, when I laid the Foundations of the Earth? &amp;c.</hi> Didſt thou then lend me an helping-Head how
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64652:64"/> to do it, or an helping-Hand in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it? Surely No, I did all my ſelf. Thoſe innumerable Beings which are on Earth, and in the Ocean; yea, that are included within the vaſt Circumference of the higheſt Heavens, are all made by him out of nothing: <hi>Through Faith we believe that the Worlds were made by the Word of God, ſo that things which are ſeen were not made of things that do appear,</hi> Heb. 11.3. The great God had no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials to make the great Houſe with, he did not frame it of his own Eſſence, or any pre-exiſtent matter, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.12. Yet ſuch admirable qualities are every where intermixt, matter and form, ſubject and and accidents, power and goodneſs, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and order; a rare ſymmetry, exact proportion, and beauty in the whole; a dependent ſubordination, and uſeful ſubſerviency, in every part ſo equally poiz'd, that it's hard to determine which bears the greateſt weight in the mighty work, and gives abundant cauſe to cry out with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, O Lord, how mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous are thy Works! in Wiſdom hast thou made them all,</hi> Pſal. 104.24.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:64652:65"/>2. He is incomparable in regard of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence:</hi> 1. For <hi>Preſervation</hi> none is like him, nay, none beſide him doth this; <hi>O thou Preſerver of Men,</hi> Job 7.20. <hi>Thy Viſitation preſerveth my Spirit,</hi> Job 10.12. God is unlike to Men; The Carpenters or Maſons build Houſes, and then leave them to the care and charge of others; but God keeps up what he ſets up. His Providence ſucceedeth Creation, and is indeed a continual Creation: <hi>Thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveſt Man and Beaſt,</hi> Pſal. 36.6. Not Food, or Air, or Sleep, but <hi>Thou preſerveſt Man and Beast:</hi> And not onely Men and Beaſts, but <hi>all things ſubſiſt by him,</hi> Coloſ. 1.17. That Hand alone which made all, can maintain all; and that Power onely which produced out of nothing, muſt preſerve from nothing; <hi>Acts</hi> 17.28. <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our beings.</hi> That Being which gave us our Beings, muſt uphold us in our Beings; Heb. 1.3. <hi>He upholdeth all things by the Word of his Power,</hi> 1. <hi>Suſtinendo,</hi> As a <hi>Pillar,</hi> or ſure Foundation, upon which they ſtand. The Air which ſurrounds the Earth and Ocean, cannot bear a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet in it hangeth the maſſy weight
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64652:65"/> of Earth and Sea: Job 26.7. <hi>He hangeth the Earth (i. e.</hi> Earth and Sea, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Globe,) <hi>upon nothing:</hi> His Power is the only Pillar that bears them up. 2. <hi>Influendo,</hi> As a <hi>Fountain</hi> from which they derive all their virtue and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: The beings and motions of all his Creatures depend wholly upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence. If he ſuſpend his Influence <hi>Coctum ſecundum,</hi> according to the School-men, the Fire will not burn, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.27. Neither can the beſt Eyes ſee, though the faculty be well diſpoſed, and the object be coloured, and at a good diſtance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.7. as hath been hinted before. It's natural to the Sun to run his Race ſtrongly and ſwiftly; yet if he doth not concur as ſwift as the Sun is, he cannot creep a Snails pace; he ſtandeth ſtill in <hi>Giboah, Joſhua</hi> 10.13. <hi>Job.</hi> 9.7.3. <hi>Conſtringendo,</hi> As a <hi>Soveraign Bond and Ligature,</hi> by which the parts of all things hold together, and are kept as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a Veſſel, from flowing abroad to their diſſolution. No Man, no Angel, can bear its own weight, much leſs the weight of another Creature: Every Creature is like a Glaſs without a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64652:66"/> which cannot ſtand alone, but muſt alwayes be in hand.</p>
               <p>It's impoſſible for the Creation, or any part of it, to bear up a moment, if God ſhould forget it, and deny his actual concurrence to it. It doth conſtantly depend on God, as the Figure of the Seal imprinted on the Water, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with-drawn, the impreſſion is inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defaced. God is to the World, as the Soul to the Body, which alone can actuate and move it, without which it cannot ſtir at all, but is as a dead Corps.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For <hi>Gubernation,</hi> He governeth all, and neither Men nor Angels can govern themſelves. The great Family of the World would ſoon loſe its beauty; yea its being, if he did not maintain its har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and concord, by guiding them in their motions, keeping them in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtations, and directing them to their ends: <hi>The Lord hath establiſhed his Throne in the Heavens, and his Kingdom ruleth over all,</hi> Pſal. 103.19. One Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would moſt cruelly devour ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Beaſts would prey on Men: All Creatures would become their own Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Executioners; The whole
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64652:66"/> Earth would be turn'd into an <hi>Achelda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and a <hi>Golgatha,</hi> a Field of Bloud, and Place of Skulls; yea, into an Hell, if he did not order, and guide, and govern all. Treaſons, Inceſt, Slaughters, Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, would over-whelm the whole World, pervert the order of Nature, turn all into Confuſion and Deſtruction; if he did not keep the Reins in his own Hands, and govern all things, in every of their actions, every moment.</p>
               <p>He governeth <hi>the highest,</hi> even the Governors themſelves on Earth, that ſeem to be above all Government: Kings and Princes ſeem to be abſolute, and wholly at their own diſpoſal; <hi>Who may ſay to a King, What dost thou?</hi> Many will tell us, That their Hands are their own, to do what they pleaſe; but more will acknowledge, that their Hearts are their own, to think as they pleaſe. But alas, they cannot command their Hands to do what they will, their Hands are ruled &amp; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by him, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.28. Herod <hi>and</hi> Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Pilate <hi>were gathered together, to do what thy Hand determined to be done.</hi> In like manner, their Hearts are not in their own Hands, to think as they will, but in God's
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64652:67"/> Hand, to think what he will: <hi>The Heart of the King is in the Hand of the Lord, and he turneth it as the Rivers of Water, which way he pleaſeth,</hi> Prov. 21.1. As the Huſbandman turneth the Sluces into his Ground, this way, or that way, into this Channel or that Channel, as he thinks beſt for his own advantage; ſo God turneth the Hearts of Kings this way or that way, which way he ſeeth moſt for his Glory: Prov. 16.9. <hi>A mans heart deviſeth his way, but the Lord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth his ſteps.</hi> No man is Maſter of himſelf, ſo much as of his Thoughts; that Heart that deviſeth its way, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in thoſe devices by God. The Sun is higher then an earthly Prince, and ſeems to be his own guide; he acteth naturally, and ſo neceſſarily: <hi>But if he ſpeak to the Sun, it riſeth not; and he ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up the Stars,</hi> Job 9.9. He hath a Negative Voice upon the motions of all Beings.</p>
               <p>He governeth the <hi>loweſt</hi> as well as the higheſt: As none are ſo high, as to be above his Precepts; ſo none are ſo low, as to be below his Providence: The higheſt muſt remember him, and he doth
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64652:67"/> not forget the loweſt; <hi>Are not two Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows ſold for a Farthing, yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Fathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> Math. 10.29. Sparrows ſeem to fly at liberty, and to fall caſually; but even their flight is directed by God, and their fall ordered by him: They neither fly nor fall accidentally, but providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
               <p>He governeth the moſt <hi>ſtubborn Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> thoſe which ſeem wholly ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable: The <hi>Winds,</hi> the <hi>high Winds, Whirle-Winds</hi> ſeem to caſt off and ſcorn all Rule and Government; but theſe Winds are at his will: <hi>Stormy-Winds ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil his Word,</hi> Pſal. 148.8. When they ruſh forth with ſuch irreſiſtable force, that neither Men, nor Trees, nor Horſes can ſtand before them; He <hi>rideth on their Wings,</hi> and hath them more at command then a ſkilful Rider hath an Horſe, to turn this way, or that way, at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.10. They are all at his beck: He <hi>cauſeth them to blow,</hi> Pſal. 147.18. And ceaſeth them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.26. The wiſe man tells us, <hi>He hath them in his fist,</hi> Prov. 30.4. He can hold
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64652:68"/> them faſt, or let them looſe, as a man, what he hath in his fiſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Waves</hi> ſeem rougher then the Winds: The Waters are moiſt Bodies, that are with much difficulty contained in their own bounds, eſpecially when the Winds croſs them, &amp; contend with them; but <hi>he ſitteth on the Floods,</hi> Pſal. 29.11. As a Prince on his Throne, enjoyning and forcing Obedience and Submiſſion: <hi>He bindeth the Waters in a Garment,</hi> Prov. 30.4. As Women their ſucking Infants in Mantles, with ſwadling-Bands, which they cannot get out of; though the Sea be ſuch a Giant, ſuch a Monſter, that it ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth up thouſands, and burieth them in its Belly, that it maketh all to ſhake and tremble, when it roareth and rageth; yet to God, it's but a little Infant, which he ordereth as he pleaſeth, and can lay to ſleep, or make quiet in an inſtant, when it's never ſo tempeſtuous: <hi>When I made the Cloud the Garment thereof, and thick Darkneſs its Swadling-Band,</hi> Job 38.9. Some earthly Princes heated with Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and drunk with Pride, have caſt Shackles into the Sea, threatning it with bondage, if he did not obey them.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64652:68"/> 
                  <hi>Xerxes</hi> commanded ſo many ſtrokes to be given the Sea, as a Puniſhment of its Rebellion againſt his will; but ſuch actions are the higheſt folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Many have had great Command at Sea, but none ever had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Sea, ſave God. As tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous and outragious as it is, it's his quiet Priſoner, and ſtirs not without his leave, nor otherwiſe then he lengthens its Chain: <hi>I ſet Bars and Doors, and ſaid, Hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no farther, and here ſhall thy proud Waves be ſtay'd,</hi> Job 38.10, 11.</p>
               <p>It may eaſily be proved, that the Sea is higher then the Earth, and why then doth it not over-flow it, and drown its Inhabitants? ſurely no reaſon can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but the Command the great God hath over it; Pſal. 104.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>The Waters ſtood above the Mountains; At thy rebuke they fled, at the Voice of thy Thunder they haſted away: They go up by the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, they go down by the Vallies, unto the place which thou haſt founded for them: Thou haſt ſet a bound, that they may not paſs over; that they turn not again to cover the Earth.</hi> The Waters did once cover
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64652:69"/> the Earth, till God broke up for them his decreed place, <hi>Job</hi> 38.10. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them into their appointed Channels. They have a propenſity and inclination ſtill to cover the Earth again: What doth their conſtant beating upon their Banks with rage and fury, and now and then encroaching upon the Earth, and getting ground of it ſignifie? but their deſire and longing to beat down all before them, and turn the dry Land into a Sea. The onely reaſon why they do not accompliſh their ends, is, becauſe the great Governor of the World hath ſet them their bounds, which they cannot paſs.</p>
               <p>Some men are extream ſtubborn and refractory, as immoveable as Rocks, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved and fixt for their own Wills and Wayes; but even theſe God ordereth at his pleaſure. The King of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſeem'd an untameable Beaſt, he had forraged ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Countries and Kingdoms, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on many Idols and falſe gods; and he cometh in a full career againſt the People of God, like a Lion greedy of his prey, no way doubting but to tear them in pieces, and devour them, as you may
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64652:69"/> read in 37. and 38. Chapters of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> But mark how God governs this wild Aſs, and hath this Monſter at command, Iſa. 38.29. <hi>I will put my Hook into thy Noſe, and my Bridle in thy Lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou cameſt. I will put my Hook into thy Noſe,</hi> an alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either to a Fiſher, when he hath the Fiſh faſt on his Hook, draweth it which way he will, <hi>Job</hi> 41.1. Or to ſuch Rings as men put into the Noſes of Bears to keep them in, and govern them with: <hi>My Bridle into thy Lips,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 19.4, 9.</note> my Bit in thy Mouth, and my Curb about thy Jaws, an alluſion to them that ride Horſes, who with Bridle and Bit, rein and reſtrain them, and keep them within compaſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.9. <hi>James</hi> 3.3. As if God had ſaid, becauſe thou raveſt and rageſt like ſome huge unruly Fiſh, or ſome fierce wild Beaſt, I will take thee with my Hook, and I will ring thee, and curb thee, and lead thee, and draw thee whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I liſt.</p>
               <p>The Devils are more untractable then Winds, and Waves, and Men: They have great Power; hence called <hi>The ſtrong man,</hi> Luke 11.21. <hi>And Powers,</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:64652:70"/> Eph. 6.12. Their union doth much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their ſtrength, <hi>Vis unita fortior:</hi> They are ſo much one in their Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and all their Conſpiracies, that they are called <hi>The evil One, The wicked One,</hi> Matth. 13.28. <hi>The Devil,</hi> 1 Peter 5.8. Becauſe though they are many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, yet they agree and unite againſt God, as if they were all but one.

               <p>Add to theſe, their innate impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable hatred of God, which makes them imploy all their Power, and improve all their Policy to offend and diſpleaſe him, to break from under his Yoke and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; yet in ſpight of all their Might, their Craft, their Malice, he governeth them as a man doth his Priſoners, whom he hath in Fetters: <hi>He hath reſerved them in Chains of Darkneſs,</hi> Jude verſe 6. He hath them ever in the Chains, 1. Of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64652:70"/> their own terrifying affrighting Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which allow them no reſt Day or Night: Indeed, all time is a dark dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful time to them, and all places are dark diſmal places to them; they are where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they go as Priſoners with Fetters upon them, yea ſuch Shackels as enter into and pierce their Spirits in Chains of Darkneſs. 2. In Chains of Divine Providence: God governeth their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and all their motions; they go no whither but as he pleaſeth, though they go up and down in the Earth. As ſubtile a Spirit as the Devil is, he cannot touch <hi>Job,</hi> Job 1.12. No, nor the Swine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God's leave, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.31.

               <p n="3">3. HE is incomparable in the <hi>Work of Redemption:</hi> And truly, this Work is his Maſter-piece, pure Workmanſhip; and indeed all his Works of Creation and Providence are ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to this: All his Attributes ſparkle moſt gloriouſly in this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.16. All his Angels in Heaven admire and adore him for this, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.10, 11.

No Angels, no Men, no not all together, could with all their united Worthineſs redeem one Soul: <hi>None of them can redeem his Brother, or give to God a Ranſome for him: For the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the Soul is precious, it ceaſeth for ever,</hi> Pſal. 49.9, 10.</p>
               <p>None beſide God had <hi>pitty</hi> enough for mans miſery, or <hi>Wiſdom</hi> enough to find out a Remedy, or <hi>Power</hi> enough for his Recovery.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:64652:71"/>
               <p>None had <hi>pity</hi> enough for mans Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Boundleſs Miſery call'd for bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Mercy; One deep for another: But where is ſuch Mercy to be found among the Creatures? Man was a <hi>Child of Wrath,</hi> had plunged himſelf into an Ocean of Evils and Fury, and this required an Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of Love and Pity, but Creatures at moſt had but drops; but the Creator had infinite Grace for infinite Guilt, and infinite Mercy for infinite Miſery, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>In the day of thy Nativity, thou waſt cast out, to the loathing of thy Perſon; thy Navel was not cut, neither waſt thou ſalted with Salt, nor waſhed with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Here is miſery indeed, but what help or compaſſion from Creatures? tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly none: <hi>No Eye pitied thee, to do any of theſe things unto thee;</hi> (who then had pity enough?) <hi>Then I paſſed by thee, and ſaw thee in thy Blood; Then was my time of Love, and I bid thee live; yea, when thou waſt in thy Bloud, I ſaid unto thee live.</hi> God hath <hi>great Mercy</hi> for great Miſery, Eph. 2.4, 5. <hi>Abundant Mercy</hi> for abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Miſery, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.3. A Plaiſter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as broad and as large as the Sore, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64652:72"/> Therefore the Holy Ghoſt obſerveth, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.7, 8. In the Work of Redemption, the <hi>tender Mercy of our God from on high hath viſited us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None had <hi>Wiſdom</hi> enough to find out a Remedy: Had the Creatures had pity enough, and kindneſs enough, they had not wiſdom enough to make Juſtice and Mercy meet together, and Righteouſneſs and Grace kiſs each other. If God ſhould have offered Man his Pardon and Life, upon Condition, that he with Angels ſhould conſult, and find out ſome way to ſatisfie his infinite Juſtice, that was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by Sin; Alas, poor man muſt of neceſſity have periſhed; what Creature was able to undertake the ſatisfaction of infinite Juſtice? It would have Bankrupt them all to ſatisfie for one of the ſmalleſt Sins. And who could have thought of God, the Creator to undertake it? who durſt have preſumed to entertain ſuch a motion in his Heart? Could it have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the mind of Men or Angels, that the Law might be fulfilled in its Commands and Curſe, the Glory of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice and Holineſs ſalved, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable man eternally ſaved.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:64652:72"/>
               <p>No Creature would have thought of a way to reconcile the Juſtice and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, no Creature could have thought of any way for it, nay, no Creature durſt have thought of ſuch a way as God hath found out. No, He that made the World by his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.24. when it had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made it ſelf; new made it by his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Hence the Redemption of man is called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the <hi>manifold,</hi> the <hi>curious,</hi> the embroydered Wiſdom of God; ſuch Wiſdom as paſſed the Knowledge of Angels, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.10.

               <p>Again, None had <hi>Power</hi> to have gone through with the Work, if they had had Wiſdom to have found out a way: There was ſo much to be done in order to mans Recovery, that it would have undone all the World, if they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken it. The Powers of Hell muſt be over-come, the Curſe of the Law,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64652:73"/> and Wrath of the Law-Giver, muſt be born; Sin that was ſo ſtrong and faſt in the Heart of Man, muſt be ſubdued, Grace and Holineſs, againſt which Man had an emnity, muſt be infuſed; and what Power leſs then Omnipotent could effect either of theſe? God who diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd great Power in creating the World of nothing, diſcover'd much greater in redeeming the World when it was worſe then nothing. In the former he had no oppoſition, in the latter, his Law, Juſtice, the Devils of Hell; nay, Man himſelf did reſiſt and oppoſe him: It had been impoſſible for the Mediator to have born up, and held out under all thoſe conteſts with the Powers of Darkneſs, the Malediction of the Law, the Fury of his Father, if the Almighty everlaſting Arms had not been under him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, 2. <hi>Behold my Servant, whom I upheld,</hi> Iſa. 49.8, 9. Therefore you read of Power, great Power, mighty Power, greatneſs of Power, exceeding greatneſs of Power, put forth in the Work of Redemption; Eph. 1.19, 20. <hi>And what is the exceeding greatneſs of his Power to us-ward? who believe according
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64652:73"/> to the working of the mighty Power which he wrought in Christ, when he raiſed him from the dead.</hi> And the Redeemer is called <hi>The Power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.24. <hi>The Arm of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 53.1. His <hi>Strength,</hi> Iſa. 27.5. Once more we read, <hi>Thy Redeemer is mighty, the Lord of Hoſts is his Name,</hi> Jer. 50.34.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is incomparable (not onely in what he hath done, but alſo) <hi>in what he can do.</hi> He can do what he will, nay he can do much more then he will do.</p>
               <p>He can do <hi>what he will;</hi> His Arm is as large as his Mind, and his Hand equal to his Heart. His will and pleaſure is the onely boundary of his Strength and Power: <hi>Whatſoever the Lord pleaſed, that did he in Heaven and Earth, and the Seas, and in all deep Places,</hi> Pſal. 135.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.3. Can this be ſaid of Men or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? Can they do what they pleaſe? ſurely No. But the Lord doth what he hath a mind to do: <hi>He is of one mind, and who can turn him? and what his Soul deſireth, that he doth,</hi> Job 23.13. His Heart onely can limit his Hands, and his Strength is determined by nothing but his will. It was the ſaying of a Prince,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64652:74"/> that he could bear a Circle about his Head (meaning his Crown) but he could not bear a <hi>Circle about his Feet,</hi> he would go and come at his own pleaſure, and do what he thought fit; but all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the World have Fetters about their Feet, and Chains about their Hands. They cannot go whither they pleaſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.33, 34. <hi>Zenacherib</hi> would needs go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and bringeth an Army againſt it for that end, but his Feet were fettered: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord concerning the King of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>He ſhall not come into this City; by the way that he came, by the ſame ſhall he return.</hi> Neither can they do what they pleaſe: As they go (not whither they will, but) whither God pleaſeth; ſo they do (not what they will, but) what God pleaſeth, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.27, 28.</p>
               <p>It's Gods incomparable Prerogative to go whither, and do what he will: God doth not do many things that he can, but he doth all things that he will: He can do more then he will. He cannot do what is ſinful, he cannot lie, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.2. He <hi>cannot deny himſelf,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.13. He cannot do that which implyeth a

He can make millions of Worlds in a moment, and unmake them again as ſoon: He can kill and make alive in the twinkling of an Eye; He can build up, and pluck down, take Nature off its Hinges, and ſet it on again; make the Waters when they run never ſo violently, to ſtand ſtill; ſtop the Sun in its full career; keep the hotteſt Fire from burning, or ſo much as ſinging an Hair. <hi>Shall the Sun go backward</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ten degrees or forward,</hi> 2 Kings 20.9, 10.

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> God incomparable in the manner of his Working: He worketh irreſistibly, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily.</head>
               <p n="2">2. IF you conſider the <hi>manner</hi> of his Working, He is incomparable therein alſo.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He worketh <hi>irreſistibly:</hi> He work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo, as none can hinder him: All the united Wiſdom, Power of Men, of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, cannot ſtop him at his Work. The mighty King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was taught this Truth, when he was grazing among the Beaſts, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.35. <hi>He doth according to his will in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth, and none can ſtay his Hand.</hi> Mark, He doth what he will, and none can ſtay his Hand; the Prayers of his People have ſometimes ſtay'd his Hand, when he was going to ſlay and deſtroy, but it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe out of his Grace he ſtay'd it himſelf. Alas, what Creature can ſee, or know, or reach his Hand, that is inviſible and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſent, Iſa. 48.10. <hi>My Counſel ſhall
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64652:76"/> ſtand, and I will do all my Pleaſure.</hi> The Counſels of Men do not alwayes ſtand, he makes them to fail and fall: <hi>He bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Counſels of the Heathen to naught, and maketh the Devices of the People of none effect,</hi> Pſal. 33.10 But none can make his Counſel void, or his Devices invalid.</p>
               <p>What he will do he doth, and there is no withſtanding him: If he will bring an Enemy againſt a Nation, none can prevent their coming: <hi>Calling the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous Bird from the East, the Man that executeth my Counſel from a far Country, (Cyrus</hi> that ſhould ſeiſe on <hi>Babylon,</hi> as a Ravenous Bird on his Prey) <hi>yea, I have ſpoken it, and I will bring it to paſs;</hi> (Let me ſee who ſhall hinder it,) <hi>I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, and I will do it.</hi> I would ſee who dares undertake to oppoſe it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11, 12.</p>
               <p>If he will deprive Men of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Grandeur, of their Eſtates and Treaſures, of their Might and Power; there is no contending with him, it muſt be done; Job 9.4, 12. <hi>Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him?</hi> If he will take away, nothing ſhall ſtand in his
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64652:76"/> way. The four great ſtrong Monarchies of the World, that ſucceſſively were the dread and terrour of the Earth, were taken away by him, and who hindered him? All their Policy and Power could not prevent him, or hinder their Ruine, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44.</p>
               <p>God hath a <hi>Negative Voice</hi> upon the motions of all the Creatures: <hi>Who is he that ſaith, and it cometh to paſs, if the Lord commandeth it not?</hi> Lament. 3.27. They who reckon without him, muſt reckon again: They muſt aſk his leave; as well as have his aſſiſtance, or ſit ſtill and do nothing. Their Wheels, though never ſo well oyl'd, ſtand ſtill, or go backward, if he ſay Nay, to their motion forward; <hi>He ſpeaketh to the Sun, and it riſeth not, and ſealeth up the Stars,</hi> Job 9.7. No day, not the leaſt light in the Heavens at night without his leave; but no Creature hath a Negative Voice upon the leaſt of his Actions: What he will do he doth, and never aſketh Men or Angels leave. Nay, challengeth them to hinder him if they can, Iſa. 43.13. I <hi>will Work, who ſhall let it?</hi> Obſerve his Reſolution, <hi>I will Work;</hi> He ſpeaks like
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64652:77"/> one in Authority, that is above all Checks and Controls, that can make good what he purpoſeth in ſpight of all oppoſition; <hi>I will Work;</hi> Obſerve alſo his Challenge, <hi>who ſhall let it?</hi> Would I could ſee the Man, the Angel, that durſt ſtand in the way of my motions. The Jews might think <hi>Babylon</hi> will let: <hi>I</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>have ſent to</hi> Babylon, <hi>and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed all their Princes, I have broken in pieces thoſe Iron Bars;</hi> There is no fear that they ſhould hinder my entrance into their City.</p>
               <p>He can give a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Attempts, and ſtrongeſt Deſigns of Creatures: He can blow on them, and they are ſoon blaſted, all their politick Conceptions prove abortive: <hi>Take Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel together, and it ſhall come to nought,</hi> Iſa. 8.10. Their moſt powerful Engins prove ineffectual, Verſe 9. <hi>Gird your ſelves, and ye ſhall be broken in pieces.</hi> Some of them talked at a great, at a high rate; <hi>We will go up againſt</hi> Judas <hi>and destroy it, and ſet a King in the midſt thereof, even the Son of</hi> Tabeal; But they ſpeak beyond their ſtrength, and <hi>reckon</hi> (as we ſay) <hi>without their Hoſt; Thus ſaith
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64652:77"/> the Lord God, It ſhall not ſtand, neither ſhall it come to paſs,</hi> Iſa. 7.6, 7. But none can give a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to the leaſt of his Attempts: <hi>Behold he breaketh down, and it cannot be built up again; he ſhutteth up a Man, and there can be no opening,</hi> Job 12.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He worketh <hi>arbitrarily,</hi> according to his own will: He doth what he will, and he alone may do what he will. It is argued by many, that ſome Princes are not accountable for what they do to any Men, but all hold they are accountable to God. They are his Stewards and Deputies, and muſt give an account to him of their Stewardſhips. They are his Creatures, and are, or ought to be, limited by his Laws, and ſo muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible to him for their Carriages and Government. No King is abſolute or arbitrary in his Governments, becauſe all Kings are his Subjects, and owe Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to His Majeſty, and Obedience to his Commands: But God is abſolute and arbitrary, and may do what he will do; every thing that he doth is juſt, becauſe he doth it: <hi>He doth what he will in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and none can ſay unto him,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64652:78"/> what dost thou?</hi> Dan. 4.35. He is reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to none for any of his Actions; none may queſtion him, much leſs quarrel with him for what he doth: Angels are far from being arbitrary, His will, not their own, is their Rule, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20. <hi>Ye Ministers of his, that do his Pleaſure.</hi> He onely that is above all Law, is above all Tranſgreſſion, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.3. And he whoſe will is the onely Rule of Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Righteouſneſs, may well do what he will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2.</p>
               <p>He hath an <hi>abſolute illimited Propriety in all the Works of his Hands:</hi> He is the great Proprietor of all the World, and therefore may diſpoſe of all at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.13, 15. <hi>May I not do what I will with mine own? Friend, I do thee no wrong;</hi> Though men may have a civil Right to their Eſtates, and a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Right to themſelves and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; yet the Original in all is ſtill God's. He diveſts himſelf of nothing, by lending any thing to us, or truſting us with it; and therefore he may uſe what is his own, at his own liberty and pleaſure, and none may queſtion or quarrel With him for it.</p>
               <p>Again, He is <hi>Supreme,</hi> and ſo above all
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64652:78"/> anſwering, or accounting for any thing he doth: He is the <hi>most high, Pſal.</hi> 92.1. It's no diſparagement to Men or Angels to be under a Law; nay, 'tis eſſential to them as they are Creatures: But he that is Supreme, and giveth all Laws to others, is under no Law himſelf: Indeed, if he had a Superior, he might be called to account by him: But <hi>why ſtriveſt thou against him? he giveth no account of any of his matters,</hi> Job 33.13. <hi>Why ſtrivest thou againſt him?</hi> Not by open force, but ſecret murmurings, and logical arguings, againſt his providential Diſpenſations; It's vain, <hi>for he giveth no account of any of his matters.</hi> He is not bound to tell thee what he doth, or why he doth it: He hath received nothing from thee, and ſo not bound to account to thee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35. Thou haſt no Authority to call him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; what Man or Angel hath Power to call him to account? In the next Chapter the Holy Ghoſt doth fully ſpeak for our purpoſe, Job 34.10, 12, 13. <hi>Far be it from God, that he ſhould do wickedly; and from the Almighty, that he ſhould pervert Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Who hath given him a Charge of the Earth?</hi> Whoſe Deputy is he in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64652:79"/> of the World? If he be a Deputy or Vice-Roy to any Superior Power, then he muſt keep cloſe to the Inſtructions, and act according to the Commiſſion he receiveth from them, or be accountable for his wandrings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations; But <hi>who hath given him a Charge over the Earth?</hi> What Man? what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel? where is he? what or who is he that hath given him a charge? If there were one higher then God to give him a Rule, then if he ſwerved from it, he was faulty; but becauſe he is higher then the higeſt of Beings, and his own Law, therefore he may do what he will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame: <hi>Who hath enjoyned him his way? or can ſay unto God, Thou haſt wrought Iniquity?</hi> Job 36.23. God's way is his method of Working, his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of governing the World: Now ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, Who hath any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over him, to injoyn him his way of working, the Path in which he ſhould walk, that in caſe he ſtept aſide, he might ſay unto him, <hi>Thou hast wrought Iniquity?</hi> No, not any; and therefore its deſperate preſumption for any to complain of him what ever he doth: <hi>Who art thou that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64652:79"/> replyest against God?</hi> Rom. 9.20. He is a bold Man indeed that will contend with his Maker; Who art thou? what manner of Man? what monſter of Men? Who art thou, a clod of Clay, a lump of Earth, a ſink of Sin, a fire-brand of Hell, that thou dareſt chop Logick with God? For ſhame ſet ſtill, lay thy Hand on thy Mouth, and be ſilent.</p>

               <p n="3">3.

               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:64652:80"/>
               <p>In the <hi>Creation,</hi> though the building be large and vaſt, yet with what eaſe did he ſet it up? He did not blow or ſweat, no nor ſo much as ſtir at his Work. The whole World conſiſteth of the caeleſtial and terreſtial Globe, and both were the product of <hi>his Word:</hi> For the Heavens, Pſal. 33.6. <hi>By the word of the Lord the Heavens were made, and all the Host thereof by the breath of his Mouth.</hi> It was but a <hi>word,</hi> a <hi>breath,</hi> that produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that vaſt circumference of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and all thoſe great Luminaries there: So for the Earth, <hi>He ſpake, and it was done; he commanded, and it ſtood fast,</hi> verſe 9. He onely ſpake the word, and even non-entities obey'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Beings. Therefore in the ſtory of the Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. we find in every Days-work, God only commanding, and and immediately all things concurring, <hi>verſe</hi> 3, 9, 12.</p>
               <p>In his Works of <hi>Providence,</hi> he doth all things with unconceiveable eaſe.</p>
               <p>If he deſtroy and pull down, it is done with eaſe; <hi>They are cruſhed as a Moth,</hi> Job 4.19. How eaſily doth a Man cruſh a Moth between his Fingers? with more

By a blaſt, a breath; it's eaſie to breath, to ſend forth a blaſt for a Man; but much eaſier for God, who breathed into Man the breath of Life: This can put him to no pain, no toil, no trouble at all. <hi>Zenacherib</hi> comes againſt <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> with a great Army of Warriers, and had, as he ſaith, <hi>Counſel and Strength for War:</hi> God undertakes to deal with him on the behalf of his own People, and to deſtroy him; but ſee with what eaſe God doth it, 2 Kings 19.17. <hi>I will ſend a blaſt upon him: I will never trouble my ſelf to uſe my Artillery, or draw out my great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Heaven, my Thunders and Lightnings againſt ſo many thouſand Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; I will onely blow upon them, that ſhall be all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He deſtroyeth with a <hi>word;</hi> If he do but ſpeak, it's done: His ſaying, is doing: <hi>At what time I ſpeak concerning a Nation, to pull down, and to destroy,</hi> Jer. 18.7, 8.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64652:81"/> When the Prophet would ſpeak the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ruine of the <hi>Philistins,</hi> he doth it in this manner, <hi>Woe to the Inhabitants of the Sea-coaſts, the Word of the Lord is againſt you,</hi> Zeph. 2.5. <hi>i. e.</hi> The caſe is woeful, your condition is deſperate, the whole World cannot ſave you; for the <hi>Word of the Lord is against you.</hi> Men may talk, and boaſt, and threaten what they will do, when all the while their Words are but Wind, and their threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Folk live long; but the Word of God, like Lightning or Mildew, blaſteth where-ever it goes, and burns up to the very root. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> told <hi>Metellus,</hi> (when he would have prevented his rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the <hi>Roman</hi> Treaſury,) <hi>Young Man be quiet, or I'le lay thee dead at my Feet:</hi> And then to magnifie his own Power; addeth, <hi>It is harder for me to ſpeak it, then to do it.</hi> But this is certain, it's as eaſie for God to do any thing, as to ſpeak of it; yea, he doth what he will with a Word. Now how eaſie is it to ſpeak? He deſtroyeth with a <hi>Look,</hi> with a glance of his Eye; and ſurely that is eaſie to him that is all Eye, that made the Eye: <hi>In the Morning-Watch the Lord
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64652:81"/> looked through the Pillar of Fire on the Hoſt of the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>and troubled them,</hi> Exod. 14.24.

He deſtroyeth with an <hi>hiſs,</hi> O how little! how eaſie a thing is hiſſing! Iſa. 7.18. <hi>I will hiſs for the Flies of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and the Bees of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>and they ſhall come, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He deſtroyeth with a <hi>turn of his Hand,</hi> Pſal. 81.13, 14. <hi>I would ſoon have ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Enemies, and turned my Hand against them that hated them.</hi> A turn of his Hand would have ſubdued the proudeſt Enemies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and have ſtab'd them to the Heart.</p>
               <p>He delivereth his People with the greateſt eaſe: Whatſoever their Straights be, though various and difficult, yet he helpeth them out with eaſe. When they were in Captivity, ſcatter'd up and down as Exiles out of their own Country, he bringeth them Home; but how? truly, <hi>He ſaith to the North, Give up; and to the South, Keep not back, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 43.6. And both hearken to his Word, That his <hi>Sons come from far, and his Daughters from the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64652:82"/> ends of the Earth.</hi> When the Prophet would beg of him to help his afflicted People, he only deſires him to <hi>Command Deliverance for</hi> Jacob, Pſal. 44.4. If he will it, and command it, the Work is done.</p>
               <p>He ſucceedeth his Ordinances, and maketh them effectual, for enlightning the Blind, and enlivening the Dead (great Works) with eaſe: He ſaith, <hi>Live,</hi> and the dead Sinner liveth, <hi>John</hi> 5.24. He commandeth ſucceſs, and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are effectual: <hi>There the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth his Bleſſing, even life for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> Pſal. 133.3.</p>
               <p>Yea, the Ocean, that is ſuch a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Monſter, which makes ſuch an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Noiſe, and openeth its Mouth, roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and raging, as if it would certainly devour us, is quell'd and quieted with eaſe by him, <hi>Job</hi> 38.8, 9, 10, 11.

               <p>In the Work of Creation, he erected this curious large Fabrick without any Tool or Inſtrument, Iſa. 44.24. <hi>I am the Lord that made all things, that ſtretcheth forth the Heavens alone, that ſpreadeth abroad the Earth by my ſelf.</hi> Mark, he made the Heavens <hi>alone,</hi> had none with him to aſſiſt him; and he made the Earth <hi>by himſelf,</hi> call'd none from Heaven to his Aid. As he ſaid to <hi>Job, Where wast thou when I laid the Foundations of the Earth? declare, if thou haſt understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Job 38.4.

He borrowed not one hand to it: <hi>Hast thou with him ſpread out the Skie, which is ſtrong as a molten Looking-Glaſs,</hi> Job 37.18.

               <p>In works of <hi>Providence,</hi> He doth ſome great things alone by himſelf; <hi>Job</hi> 26.7. <hi>He hangeth the Earth on nothing,</hi> without an <hi>Atlas</hi> to bear it up, and he preſerves <hi>Moſes</hi> forty days without Food, <hi>Exod.</hi>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64652:83"/> then when he makes the moſt uſe of his Creatures. He uſeth Angels and Men in the Government of the World; he uſeth many means, as Food and Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Phyſick and Sleep, for the preſervation of our Health and Lives; but he doth all, as much and as ſurely as if he made not uſe of any means at all. He is the Soul of the World, that actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates every thing in it: Hence we read, That Inſtruments are called <hi>his Sword,</hi> Pſal. 17.14. <hi>His Rod,</hi> Iſa. 10.5. What can the Sword or the Rod do, without an Hand to cut or ſcourge with them; therefore when his <hi>Rod</hi> boaſteth as if it could ſcourge of it ſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.12, 13. and as if it were the <hi>Hand</hi> too; <hi>By the ſtrength of my hand have I done it; I have removed the Bounds of the People, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed their Treaſure.</hi> God quickly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts ſuch vain babling, and confutes ſuch vain glorious boaſting, verſe 15. <hi>Shall the Axe boaſt it ſelf againſt him that heweth therewith, or the Saw magnifie it ſelf against him that ſhaketh it?</hi> Thou poor proud vain-glorious Wretch, Thou art a meer <hi>Axe,</hi> a <hi>Saw,</hi> and canſt no more move or cut of thy ſelf, then a Saw or an
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64652:84"/> Axe that lyeth on the ground, which no man medleth with: Thou talketh arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly and ſaucily, as if thou didſt all, when thou didſt nothing: I did all, thou waſt all the while but the Axe and Saw in my Hand, which I made uſe of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether God have little or great means, means or no means, it's all one to him; there is not a pinn to chooſe, as we ſay, for he doth as much when he hath means, as when he hath none, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.7. <hi>It's all one with thee to help with many, or with them that have no Power.</hi> It's not the leaſt difference to him, 'tis not ſo much as the ſmalleſt duſt in the Ballance to turn the Scale of Victory, whether God have many or few, any or none of his ſide.</p>
               <p>God never made uſe of any Creatures, becauſe he had the <hi>leaſt need</hi> of them, or the <hi>leaſt help</hi> by them, but partly becauſe it is <hi>his pleaſure;</hi> he uſeth them becauſe he will uſe them: <hi>It's his pleaſure by the fooliſhneſs of Preaching, to ſave them that believe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1, 21. Not that he hath the leaſt aid from Preachers; ſo it's his pleaſure by Food and Sleep to preſerve mans life; not that he hath any help from
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64652:84"/> them: <hi>Thy Viſitation preſerveth my Spirit,</hi> Job 10.12. Partly from his <hi>own Honour.</hi> Hereby he magnifieth his <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> and ſheweth his Dominion over all his Creatures, that they are all at his beck, and he can with a ſtamp of his Foot, or a glance of his Eye, or an hiſs of his Mouth, call them from the uttermoſt parts of the World, to execute his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. <hi>My Hand hath laid the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth, my right Hand hath ſpan'd the Heavens; when I call, they ſtand up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> Iſa. 48.13. The Flies, Caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, Locuſts, Stars in their courſes, &amp;c. all come at his call. Hereby he magnifieth his <hi>Power,</hi> that can do ſuch great things by weak means: He got himſelf glory on <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when he made pitiful contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Creatures, as Lice and Flies, ſuch Plagues to him.</p>
               <p>And by opening the Eyes of the blind, and quickening the Dead, by ſuch weak poor Inſtruments as Men are, his <hi>ſtrength</hi> is exceedingly exalted; <hi>We have this Treaſure in earthen Veſſels, that the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Power might be of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.7. Hereby he magnifieth his <hi>Wiſdom viz.</hi> in diſcovering the fitneſs and apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64652:85"/> of his Creature to thoſe ends and purpoſes for which they were created. The uſe of a Tool diſcovers its worth, by diſcovering its ſerviceableneſs to that for which it was made. Partly to <hi>endear Creatures</hi> one to another; their mutual ſerviceableneſs each to other, cauſeth the greater amity and unity between them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21, 22, 23.</p>
               <p>In <hi>ſpiritual things</hi> alſo God worketh alone, even when he hath many Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Miniſters to ſerve him: <hi>Thou workeſt all our Works in us, and for us,</hi> Iſa. 26.12. Not any Viſions, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, or induſtry of our own; but <hi>thou workeſt all. What is</hi> Paul? <hi>what is</hi> Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los? Paul <hi>planteth,</hi> Apollo <hi>watereth; but God giveth the increaſe. So then</hi> (Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve) <hi>He that planteth is</hi> (a great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle? No,) <hi>nothing,</hi> and he <hi>that watereth is</hi> (an eloquent excellent perſon? No,) <hi>nothing;</hi> but God <hi>that giveth the increaſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.5, 6, 7. God doth not uſe Preachers, becauſe they help him in the converſion of Souls, but (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) becauſe it is his pleaſure, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. And he turneth it to his honour, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. Therefore it is often ſeen,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64652:85"/> that Miniſters of the largeſt Gifts, of the greateſt Grace, are not often the moſt ſucceſsful in their Labours; becauſe God would have us know, that it's not the Parts or Piety of the Preacher, but his Grace and Spirit that doth the Work: They are nothing, he is all in all. He made light the firſt day of the Creation, and not the Sun or Stars till the Fourth, to tell the World, that he can enlighten it without the Sun. It is a great Honour to God that he hath ſo many millions of Creatures at his will and pleaſure, that he hath ſo many Eyes to ſee for him, and ſo many Ears to hear for him, and ſo many Hands to work for him; but it is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Honour to him that he needeth none of them, He can do all without them; that though they are <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to him, yet they are not <hi>neceſſary</hi> to him. For God and all his Creatures do no more, can do no more then God without any of his Creatures.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, GOD is incomparable in his <hi>Word;</hi> He ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after an unſpeakable manner, <hi>Never man ſpake like him,</hi> (no, nor Angel,) his Enemies themſelves being Judges, <hi>John</hi> 7.46. Men may ſpeak high, and ſpeak holily; Angels may ſpeak higher and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, but neither ſpeak like God: <hi>Behold he exalteth by his Power, who teacheth like him?</hi> Job 36.22. Behold I wonder at it, he exalteth by his Power, is good at acting; <hi>who teacheth like him?</hi> Is good at inſtructing, and beſt at both, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all that ever were. <hi>Who teacheth like him?</hi> The words are a Challenge to the whole World: Bring forth the Man, let me ſee the Angel, that can ſpeak or teach like God. He doth not not ſay, Who teacheth <hi>beſide</hi> God? There are many Teachers beſide God, the inanimate Creatures are Teachers, the Heavens
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64652:86"/> by their conſtant regular motion, the Earth by its fecundity and fruitfulneſs, according to the law of their Creation, teach Man Obedience and Proficiency, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.13. The irrational Creatures are Teachers: Man is ſent to School to the <hi>Ant</hi> and <hi>Swallow,</hi> and <hi>Oxe</hi> and <hi>Aſs,</hi> to the Beaſts of the Field, and the Fowles of the Air, to learn Providence and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; to learn Wiſdom, to diſcern and improve his Opportunities, and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to his Father and Benefactor, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.7, <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Job</hi> 12.8, 9. Men are Teachers one to another; Parents and Miniſters do, or ſhould, teach thoſe that are committed to their Charge or Truſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.6. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are Teachers: The Angel taught <hi>Daniel,</hi> and helpt him to underſtand, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.14. And ſurely of all finite, they are the moſt learned and able Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: But he ſaith, <hi>Who teacheth like him?</hi> Though many teach beſide God, yet none teacheth like God; none ſpeaketh like him, whether you conſider the <hi>manner,</hi> the <hi>matter,</hi> or the <hi>effect</hi> of his Speech.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:64652:87"/>1. He is incomparable in the <hi>manner</hi> of his ſpeaking.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſpeaketh <hi>authoritatively,</hi> and in his own Name: Good Men and good Angels may command, but it muſt be (as ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Magiſtrates) in the Name and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their Prince and Soveraign; but God commandeth in his <hi>own Name</hi> and Authority: God gives Authentity to what-ever he ſpeaks, and he ſpeaks with Authority when he ſpeaks. God ſpeaks as one that hath Right and Power to Command, and as one that, upon his own account, expecteth to be obeyed: <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> is enough to warrant Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the whole Decalogue, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other God; Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven Image, &amp;c.</hi> For <hi>I am the Lord thy God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Authority is the higheſt, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reaſon of any Precept, and the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt warrant for Obedience; Therefore <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſwear by my Name falſly,</hi> (why?) <hi>I am the Lord: Thou ſhalt not curſe the Deaf, nor lay a ſtumbling block before the Blind,</hi> (why not? the Deaf cannot hear if I do curſe them, nor the Blind ſee if I do lay a ſtumbling-block before
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64652:87"/> them,) <hi>I am the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Levit. 19.12. &amp;c. It's ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>He taught as one having Authority, and not as the Scribes,</hi> Matth. 7. ult. He did not <hi>beg</hi> attention, but <hi>enjoyn</hi> it; nor <hi>beſeech Obedience,</hi> but <hi>command</hi> it. As when Princes Enact Laws, they do not intreat, but <hi>require</hi> Obedience at the peril of their Subjects. <hi>This is the Word of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> and <hi>the Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it,</hi> is ſufficient to awe and require Subjection from all that hear it. God is his own Authority, not ſo Men or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: They ſpeak from God, but he from none but himſelf. His Word is a <hi>Light, Pſal.</hi> 119.104, 105. that diſcovers it ſelf; And therefore it is called <hi>The Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 19.7. Becauſe it beareth witneſs to it ſelf, and needeth not teſtimony from Men or Angels. What the eſſential Word ſpeaketh, may be ſpoken of the declarative Word: It receiveth not Teſtimony from Man, <hi>John</hi> 5.34. Men need Grounds and Reaſons, and Witneſſes too, to prove and vouch what they ſay to be true, and to be ſo as they ſpeak; but the Word of God is a ſufficient authentick Teſtimony to it
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64652:88"/> ſelf; It's his own Proof, becauſe what Truth it ſelf ſpeaks, muſt of neceſſity be true.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſpeaketh <hi>condeſcendingly,</hi> to the condition and underſtanding of thoſe to whom he ſpeaketh: He conſidereth the Natures and Tempers, and Capacities of his Hearers, and accordingly ſpeaks to them: He doth not (as ſome Miniſters) ſpeak in an <hi>unknown Tongue,</hi> or ſoar into the Clouds, exceed the Capacities of his Hearers, that he might be wondred at, not underſtood; but he obſerveth their Weakneſs and Infirmities, yea their dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and incapacity, and teacheth them as they are able to hear him. There are <hi>Depths</hi> in his Word for Elephants to <hi>ſwim</hi> in, (to tell the World what and how he could ſpeak, to exerciſe our induſtry, and prevent our contempt of it for its plainneſs,) and there are <hi>Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows</hi> for Lambs to <hi>wade</hi> through, that none might be diſcouraged. Chriſt is our Prieſt, and the Prieſts Lips teach knowledge, and he is a merciful Prieſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. Condeſcending in what he teacheth, and in the way of his teaching, to the capacities of his Hearers.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:64652:88"/>
               <p>In <hi>what he teacheth:</hi> How chary was Chriſt of charging his Diſciples with any thing that they could not brook, <hi>John</hi> 16.12. <hi>I have many things to ſay unto unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</hi> I have ſome harder Leſſons to teach you, but ye are young Schollars, and not able yet to learn them, till ye have been long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in my School, and have attained more ripeneſs of underſtanding; therefore I will not trouble you now with them, but leave them to my Spirit, who ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare you for them, and enable you to learn them: Your Stomachs are weak, and yet muſt have that onely which is of light Digeſtion, Milk, not ſtrong meat, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2. Your Backs are not ſtrong, and therefore I will lay on you none but light burdens, <hi>But ye cannot bear them now;</hi> and therefore ye ſhall not hear them now, leaſt ye ſhould be offended and diſcouraged at them. When the Jews enquired of Chriſt, why his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples did not faſt often, as well as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>John,</hi> and the Phariſees: Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the reaſon our tender-hearted Lord gives, <hi>Math.</hi> 9.15, 16, 17. <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>puts new Wine into old Bottles, leaſt the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64652:89"/> Wine burst the Bottles; or ſoweth an old Garment to new Cloth, least the rent be worſe.</hi> Alas, ſaith he, my Diſciples are young Beginners, <hi>Babes</hi> in me, at beſt but <hi>little Children,</hi> not <hi>ſtrong Men,</hi> or <hi>Fathers,</hi> and therefore they muſt not be called preſently to the Auſterities or Severities of Religion, leaſt they, poor Souls, ſhould be diſcouraged in their Work, and faint under it: I muſt proportion their Burden to their Backs, and lead them their own pace, as they are able to go at preſent. Hereafter indeed they ſhall be called to ſuffer great things for my Names ſake; they ſhall be hated and perſecuted of all men, but then they ſhall be fitted for thoſe Severities, and undergoe them with courage; but yet ſuch deep Points, and obſcure Notions, muſt not be offered to Novices.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>way of his teaching,</hi> he is very tender and condeſcending; He accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modates his Diſcourſe to their Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, Mark 4.33. <hi>He ſpake as they were able to bear it;</hi> Not as he was able to ſpeak, (he was able to read Lectures above the capacities of Angels) but <hi>as they were able to bear it.</hi> Therefore he
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64652:89"/> ſpake ſo much to them in Parables, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they might the better underſtand him: For though a Parable would make Truth more obſcure, (and ſo Parables and Dark-Sayings are conjoyn'd, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.78. and to ſpeak in Parables, is oppos'd to ſpeaking plainly, <hi>John</hi> 16.26. <hi>John</hi> 16.29.) yet a Parable reveal'd, unvail'd, (as Chriſt did uſually to his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.17, 37.) makes Truth more clear. It gives us the advantage of viewing heavenly Truth in earthly Glaſſes, the Species and Reflections of which we are moſt able to conceive; Therefore our Saviour ſaith, <hi>If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not,</hi> (or cannot underſtand) <hi>how ſhall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly,</hi> John 3.12.</p>
               <p>The Inſtructions of Chriſt were like <hi>Water,</hi> Deut. 32.2. which he powred into thoſe narrow-mouth'd Veſſels by little and little, as they were able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; or as <hi>Rain,</hi> which he diſtil'd on his Hearers (as Rain on the mown Graſs) by drops, and drop after drop, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh them; not by Floods to drown them. <hi>Jacob</hi> conſider'd the Children were young, and the Cattel were with young,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64652:90"/> therefore drove gently, leaſt by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driving he ſhould wrong them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.13. So our Lord Jeſus conſidereth what Men are, how impotent and infirm, and will not over-drive, over-do, leaſt he ſhould undo them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.9, 10. He gives <hi>Precept upon Precept, Line upon Line, Here a little, there a little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will Men or Angels teach with ſuch compaſſion, with ſuch condeſcenſion? It is a Rule of one of the Ancients, That he who will teach Children, muſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be a Child: He muſt frame and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf to them, and be as one of them, or elſe he will never teach them. How ſoon would the dulneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardneſs of Man tire out the patience of Men and Angels, and provoke them to give over teaching them: God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparableneſs herein is fully proved in the incomparableneſs of God in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, in Chap. 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſpeakes <hi>effectually:</hi> As he hath Power to command us, ſo he hath Power to enable us to obey his Commands. Men and Angels may <hi>tell</hi> Men their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but they cannot <hi>teach</hi> Men their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; they cannot ſtrengthen them, or
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64652:90"/> impower them to obey: He ſpeaketh ſo as Men hear, and believe and live; <hi>He that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me,</hi> John 6.45. We have a ſaying, <hi>Ex quovis ligno non fit Mercurius,</hi> Every man will not make a Mercury: Some ſo dull and blockiſh, that none can improve them, or do good upon them, <hi>i. e.</hi> no Creature can;<note place="margin">Iſa. 32.4.</note> but God can make the dull, the blind, the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, to conceive and conſider, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and underſtand the darkeſt and moſt difficult Points by ſpeaking to them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.17. <hi>He teacheth to profit;</hi> There is a Power that accompanieth his teaching, that doth the Work. When he ſaith, Let there be Light in a dark Mind, there is Light; it is ſo: He is a God <hi>that commandeth Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6. When he ſaith, Let there be life in that dead Soul, there is life, it is ſo, <hi>John</hi> 5.24. Men and Angels may call long enough to the Blind to ſee, and the Dead to live, and all in vain. But if a God ſay to a Sinner that lyeth rotting in the Grave, almoſt eaten up of the Vermine of Luſts, unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory, and ſtinking in the eyes of all men,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64652:91"/> 
                  <hi>Lazarus, Sinner, come forth of thy curſed carnal condition;</hi> The man that was bound Hand and Foot, manacled and fetter'd by the Devil, his Jaylor, comes forth, is looſed of his Bonds, and lives for ever.</p>
               <p>As the Mariners ſaid of Chriſt, He ſpeaketh with Authority, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Winds and Seas, and they obey him; <hi>What manner of Man is this?</hi> Math. 8.27. So I may ſay, O what manner of God is this, for he ſpeaks with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the high winds of violent Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the fierce Waters of boiſterous Corruptions, and they obey him; they fly, they fall before him? Can Men or Angels ſpeak at this rate? will Sin die at their word? will the Soul live at their command? How long may they call to Sinners to ariſe from the Dead, before they will, before they can anſwer their call?</p>
               <p>But if God ſpeaks, the moſt obſtinate, hardened Sinner obeyeth his Voice, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth to his Will, and yieldeth himſelf up to his Word; nay, the very Devils are forced to leave their beloved Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the Souls of Men, and to ſeek and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64652:91"/> ſetttle their Habitations elſewhere. He commandeth, and the unclean Spirits come out of Men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.32. If he pleaſe but to ſay, <hi>Get thee behind me Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> that Prince of the Powers of the Air, that god of the World, who crows ſo much on his own Dunghill, the Hearts of the Unregenerate, ſneakes away like a Coward, and muſt in ſpight of his Teeth obey his Command, <hi>Math.</hi> 4.10, 11. Yea, God ejecteth him with a word ſpeaking, out of his ſtrongeſt Holds, the Souls of old, ſenſleſs, ſeared Sinners, and leads Captivity captive, and makes this Jaylor, who laid ſo many in Irons, his Priſoner and Captive.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Purity</hi> of its Precepts: His
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64652:92"/> Word is the moſt pure, perfect, exact Rule of Righteouſneſs that is imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: It commandeth good, nothing but good, and all good, at all times; It forbiddeth evil, all evil, and nothing but evil, and alwayes: <hi>The Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is holy, and the Law is holy, just, and good,</hi> Rom. 7.12. <hi>Holy,</hi> as it is a Copy of the Divine Will; <hi>Juſt,</hi> as it is corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent to the higheſt reaſon; <hi>Good,</hi> as it is moſt beneficial to the rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is <hi>holy,</hi> as it relates our Duty to God; <hi>Just,</hi> as it reſpects our Duty to our Neighbours; <hi>Good,</hi> as it concerns our Duty towards our Selves. It is <hi>Holy,</hi> as conſecrated to the Service of God; <hi>Just,</hi> as a tranſcript of the pure Law of Nature; <hi>Good,</hi> as it is the meaſure and ſtandard of all goodneſs in the Creatures. It is <hi>Holy,</hi> in what it enjoyns us to do; <hi>Just,</hi> in what it forbids us to do, and <hi>good</hi> in both. What Laws in the World are in any degree comparable to the Laws of God? The <hi>Mahometan</hi> Laws which have gained ſo much credit in the greateſt part almoſt of the known <hi>World,</hi> are impure Laws, allowing Revenge, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligamy, and commanding Slaughters,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64652:92"/> Oppreſſions, &amp;c. for the Propagation of their Religion.</p>

How many Sins againſt the very Law of Nature did that <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Law-Giver allow of? and where he or any of the reſt did forbid Sin, it was in the outward actions, not in the inward affections: Their Laws did rather Command the covering of Sin, that it might not appear abroad, then the killing of Sin, that it might not be at all: Their Laws were defective as to <hi>perſons,</hi> ſome Men were uſually priviledged, and not bound to them; as to the <hi>parts</hi> of men, they gave the inward man liberty, though they reſtrained the outward, as to <hi>Puniſhments;</hi> the greateſt Penalty they could think of, or impoſe, was a Temporal Death; They never dreamed of an Hell in another World.

So pure, that there is not the leaſt mixture, falſhood or error in it: It commands all, and nothing but,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64652:93"/> conformity to the mind of the great Soveraign, and Lord of all things: <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect,</hi> Pſal. 19.7. So per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that it is not deficient in any thing; It commandeth purity in the whole man, in every faculty of the Soul, in every member of the Body: It commandeth purity in this whole man, at all times, in all companies, in all conditions, in all relations, in all manner of converſation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.1, 2.</p>
               <p>It's apparent to common ſenſe, that fallen man could never dream of ſuch ſtrict exact Precepts, no, he is ſo far from it, that he is wholly contrary thereunto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. And Angels could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine them, unleſs God had ſignified his mind to them. For all holineſs being a conformity to the Will of the moſt high God, they could not diſcern what was holy, what was unholy, any farther then they could diſcover the Will of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>myſtery</hi> of its Doctrines: It containeth ſuch Depths, ſuch bottomleſs Profundities, that could not poſſibly have been imagin'd by Men or Angels, had not God reveal'd them. It acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64652:93"/> us with things far above the reach of created Reaſon, (though not contrary) yet being told us are ſo correſpondent, that there is no ground left for the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning them. What the great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith upon occaſion of one myſtery, we may ſay upon the whole: <hi>O the Depth! O the Depth of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God!</hi> Rom. 11.33. O the Depth of the holy Scriptures! There is a Depth in them, that none can fathome, becauſe a Depth in them that hath no bottom; <hi>Great is the mystery of the Bible:</hi> Who could think of a Womans coming into the World without a Woman, as <hi>Eve;</hi> of a mans coming into the World without a man, as the Son of man; nay, without man or woman, as <hi>Adam?</hi> who could think that the ſame Woman ſhould be a Mother &amp; a Virgin? But theſe are ſmall myſteries; who could think that many thouſands, millions, living many Miles and Ages di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, ſhould be fellow members, and be truly one Body, ſympathiſing with, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to, rejoycing in the welfare of each other; &amp; all be united unto, receive influence from, and live wholly by one Head, as far from them as Heaven is from
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64652:94"/> the Earth? <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.27, 28, 29, 30. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.19. Who could have thought that three really and perſonally diſtinct, ſhould be equal, and one in nature and eſſence? 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7.</p>
               <p>Who could have imagin'd, that God ſhould become Man, infinite become fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, the Creator a Creature; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits become Fleſh, and the Lord of Life be put to Death? Who could conceive, that he who made all things of nothing, ſhould be made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of a Woman, made by him: That he whom the Heavens, and Heaven of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens cannot contain, ſhould be contained in the narrow Womb of a Woman: That the onely Bread of Life ſhould be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, the onely Water of Life be thirſty; the onely Reſt be weary, the onely Eaſe be pained, and the onely Joy and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation be ſorrowful, exceeding ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto Death?</p>
               <p>Who could have imagin'd, that one, yea millions ſhould be rich by anothers poverty, filled by anothers emptineſs, be exalted by anothers diſgrace, healed by anothers wounds, eaſed by anothers Pains, be abſolved by anothers Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,

Could Men or Angels ſpeak ſuch Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rles? ſurely No. Several Myſteries in the Scriptures were hid from whole Ages and Generations of Men; <hi>Which in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages was not made known to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men,</hi> Eph. 3.5.

               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Propheſies</hi> and <hi>Predictions</hi> of the Word: Neither Men nor Angels can fore-tell thoſe things which depend not on natural Cauſes, or which may not be deduced from moral or political Grounds, and even in ſuch things as theſe are, they may be, and have been decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Therefore it was the ſubtilty of the old Serpent to deliver his Oracles of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64652:95"/> in ambiguous words, and in deceitful Speeches, that whatſoever happened, his Credit might be ſalved, as his <hi>Aio te Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acida Romanos vincere poſſe, &amp; Ibis redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis nunquam per bellae peribis, &amp;c.</hi> But God fore-tels what hath no print of any footing in Nature, what neither moral nor political Principles can direct unto, and never fails in his Predictions. He fore-tells the Birth of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> 100 years before he was born, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.28. The Birth of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 200 years, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.2. The Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off of the <hi>Jews,</hi> above 2000 years before it came to paſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.27. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.9, 10. He fore-tells the Birth of Chirſt, near 4000 years before he came into the World, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. And it is very obſervable, how punctual and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular he is herein, (as knowing how much the well-fare of the World did depend upon the Knowledge of the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi>) he tells you long before-hand, of what Tribe he ſhould come, of <hi>Judah;</hi> of what Family, <hi>Davids;</hi> of what Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a Virgin; where he ſhould be born, in <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> whence he muſt be called, out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> what his condition ſhould
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64652:95"/> be; in general, full of Sorrows and Griefs; in particular, that he ſhould be diſgraced and reviled, tempted, betrayed, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, deſerted by his Father and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; that he ſhould die, be pierced, not have a Bone broken; be buried, make his Grave with the Rich and the Wicked, and riſe again from the Dead, and reap the fruit of all his Paſſion, to his full ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>He hath fore-told the ſtate of the World, and the Church, in the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> from the Primitive times, to the diſſolution of the World, though it's written in ſhort-hand and in dark Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</p>
               <p>And can any Men or Angels fore-tell ſuch things? God challengeth all the gods to do this; <hi>Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods,</hi> Iſa. 41.21, 22, 23. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Prediction of future Contingents, is ſuch an inſeparable Prerogative of the Deity, and ſuch a ſpecial Priviledge of the Original of all things, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth to own their Supremacy, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their Sovereignty, who can do it. It's ſuch a Jewel in his Crown,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64652:96"/> that none ever ſhared in it: <hi>I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the former things from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: I did them ſuddenly, and they came to paſs: I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to paſs, I ſhewed it to thee,</hi> Iſa. 48.3, &amp; 5. It's pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to him, who worketh all in all, to fore-know and fore-tell whatſoever ſhall come to paſs, Acts 15.18. <hi>Known to God are all his Works, from the beginning of the World;</hi> yea, from all eternity. For he ſtood on the high Mountain of eternity, and thence had a full view of all that his will would produce, and whatſoever ſhould come to paſs.</p>

                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:64652:96"/>1. It is efficacious in <hi>converting</hi> the Soul: The word of God can ſtop the tide of nature, when it runneth with the greateſt violence; yea, it can turn it the quite contrary way: Let a man be in the height of his Strength, in the heat of his Youth, ruffling and buſsling among the Sparks of the times, taking a large draught of carnal Pleaſures, and having a full guſt of ſenſual Delights, making his whole life but a diverſion from one Pleaſure to another, (as if he were ſent into the Earth, as <hi>Leviathan</hi> into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, only to play and ſport there,) when this man is in his beſt eſtate, in the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith of Health and Strength, in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of his Age, promiſing himſelf a long day of life, and putting the day of death far from him, and thereby giving himſelf the more liberty to the ſervice of his Luſts; yet if the word of God come to this man, who ſucketh in Wind as the wild Aſſes Colt, it makes him pluck in his Plumes, bid adieu to his fooliſh Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, leave his moſt beloved Luſts, loath himſelf for ever loving them; it alters the man's Palat, that is bitter now which was ſweet before; and he cannot ſavour
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64652:97"/> what formerly was his heaven and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; it changeth the bent and frame of his heart, that now he forſaketh with deteſtation what formerly he followed after, as his onely felicity and chiefeſt good; The wild man is tame, the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate man is pliable, and the diſtracted man is recover'd to his wits, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9. Men and Angels may <hi>perſwade,</hi> but God only can <hi>prevail.</hi> The words of Creatures may work for an outward reformation, but the word of God alone for an inward renovation: He only that made the Heart can mend it. Humane Counſels may do ſomewhat towards the hiding of the corruptions of Nature, but Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions are only effectual for the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of corrupted Nature: <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul,</hi> Pſal. 19.7. Converting the Soul; The Law of man may bind the Body to its good behaviour, but the Law of God alone can bring the <hi>Soul</hi> to its good behaviour. To turn a Lion into a <hi>Lamb,</hi> Darkneſs into <hi>Light,</hi> a Stone into <hi>Fleſh,</hi> Death into <hi>Life,</hi> (all which is done in converſion) can be effected by the Word of none but a God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.8, 9, 10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64652:97"/> 
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. No word but his can take a Cions off from its own natural ſtock, and ingraft it into a new ſtock, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. <hi>James</hi> 1.21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is efficacious in <hi>affrighting</hi> the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: He ſpeaks (not as Men or Angels, to the Ears only, but) to the hidden-man of the Heart, and ſhatters it in pieces; he plants, his Batteries of Threatnings, and Terrors, and Curſes, againſt the inward man of the Conſcience, and puts it into an Ague of trembling and ſhaking Fits, (as we ſee in <hi>Herod, Acts</hi> 24.27.) and levels it to the ground. This word in the mouth of a poor Priſoner at the Bar, frights the proud ſturdy Judge on the Bench. When God ſpeaks, he makes the beſt people afraid, and cry out, <hi>Let not God ſpeak to us, leaſt we die,</hi> and the beſt of that people exceedingly to quake and fear, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.21. <hi>The Voice of the Lord is terrible, it ſhaketh the Cedars of</hi> Lebanon, <hi>it ſhattereth the Oakes of</hi> Baſhan, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64652:98"/> to call out, <hi>Sirs, What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> Acts 2.37.</p>
               <p>The moſt ſtubborn ſenſleſs Sinner, whom neither Mercies nor Miſeries could move or melt, who mocked at the Curſes of the Law, and the Wrath of the Lord; and as <hi>Leviathan</hi> laughed at the <hi>ſhaking of thoſe Spears,</hi> whom (as the man poſſeſſed with the Devil) no Cords could hold, no Chains could faſten, but he burſt all aſunder; when the Word of the Lord hath been ſpoken to him, inſtead of flying in his face (as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when men have ſpoken to him) he hath fallen down at his feet, been filled with fears and frights, felt the very Fire of Hell flaming in his conſcience, and become a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Magor Miſſabib,</hi> fear or terror to himſelf round about: The Word of God hath ſtuck in his Heart, as the Arrow in the ſide of the Buck, allowing no eaſe; whitherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath gone in the night, ſcaring him with Dreams, and terrifying him with Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; in the day admitting no reſt in his Fleſh, nor quietneſs in his Bones, forcing him in all Places, and in all Companies, ſtill to carry his Jaylour, his Tormentor, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner, along with him; and at laſt, that he might eſcape a partial and temporal, to

I may challenge every Man, every Angel, as God himſelf doth <hi>Job, Haſt thou an Arm like God? Canſt thou thunder with thy Voice like him,</hi> Job 40.9. If he utter his word of fury, the Rocks are rent in pieces, the moſt ſtony hearts are melted; the Mountains are moved, the higheſt and firmlieſt ſeated Sinners are ſhaken out of their places and ſenſes, the foundations of the World tremble and quake, the ſtrongeſt Pillars are troubled, the whole frame and body of Nature is affected with a Palſie; Pſal. 18.13. <hi>The Lord thundred in the Heavens, the higheſt gave forth his Voice,</hi> (what followeth?) <hi>Hail-ſtones and coals of fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is efficacious in <hi>healing</hi> the wounded Spirit: When God takes the Sword of the Spirit into his own Hand, and wields it with his own Arm, it makes work, it makes wounds to purpoſe in the conſciences of men; the ſleepy Soul is now awakened, the ſecure Soul is now affrighted, the ſenſleſs Soul is now affected with his ſins and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (<hi>Acts</hi> 2.37.) the man taſteth the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

               <p>I Come now to make ſome application of this great and weighty Truth: It may be uſeful by way of Information, Counſel and Comfort.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By way of <hi>Information:</hi> If God be ſo incomparable, that there is none on Earth, none in Heaven comparable to him; It may inform us,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the great <hi>venome</hi> and <hi>malignity</hi> of Sin, becauſe it is an injury to ſo great, ſo glorious, ſo incomparable a Being. The <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>better</hi> any Object is, the baſer and the worſe is that action which is injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to it: To throw dirt on Sack-cloth is not ſo bad as to throw dirt on <hi>Scarlet</hi> or <hi>fine Linnen.</hi> To make a flaw in a pebble or common ſtone, is nothing to the making a flaw in a <hi>Diamond</hi> or <hi>precious ſtone.</hi> Thoſe opprobrious Speeches, or injurious Actions, againſt an ordinary perſon, which are but a breach of the good behaviour, and bear but a common Action at Law; if againſt a

                  <hi>Prince</hi> may be <hi>high Treaſon,</hi> becauſe of the execellency of his Place, and Majeſty of his Perſon: The worth and dignity of the Object, doth exceedingly heighten and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate the Offence. How horrid then is Sin, and of how hainous a nature, when it offendeth and oppoſeth not Kings, the higheſt of men; not Angels, the higheſt of Creatures: But God, the higheſt of Beings, the incomparable God, to whom Kings and Angels; yea, the whole Creation is leſs then nothing. We take the ſize of Sin too low, and ſhort, and wrong, when we meaſure it by the wrong it doth to our ſelves, or our Families, or our Neighbours, or the Nation wherein we live; indeed herein ſomewhat of its evil and miſchief doth appear, but to take its full length and proportion, we muſt conſider the wrong it doth to this great, this glorious, this incomparable God: Sin is incomparably malignant, becauſe the God principally injur'd by it, is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably excellent. It's one thing to diſpleaſe and offend man, a poor ſlimy worm, a mean ſhallow Creature, of the ſame make and mold with our ſelves, and another thing to diſpleaſe and offend God, that unconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble immenſe Being: <hi>If one man ſin againſt
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64652:101"/> another, the Judge ſhall judge him,</hi> (an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Judge may undertake to determine and compriſe Offences between them that ſtand upon the ſame level) <hi>but if a man ſin against the Lord, who ſhall intreat for him?</hi> 1 Sam. 2.25. Here the caſe is alter'd, here is a pitiful finite Creature offending an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Creator; what man dares arbitrate this difference, nay who can intercede and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe between theſe too?</p>
               <p>Hence, hence it is that there is no leſs then an infinite demerit in ſin, becauſe its an injury to an infinite Majeſty. Nothing diſcovers ſin to be ſo great an evil, as its oppoſition to ſo vaſt, ſo matchleſs, ſo great a good, ſo incomparable a God.</p>
               <p>The evil of ſin appeareth ſomewhat in the injury it doth to our Eſtates, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 23.21. <hi>The Drunkard and Glutton ſhall come to poverty, and idleneſs ſhall cloath a man with rags.</hi>) To our Names (<hi>The name of the Wicked ſhall rot,</hi> Prov. 11.7.)

To our Souls, He <hi>that ſinneth againſt me, wrongeth his own ſoul,</hi> Prov. 8. ult. But all this diſcovers nothing of ſins evil, to that which is diſcover'd by the injury it doth to the incomparable God, becauſe our Eſtates, our Names, our Families, our Neighbours, our Nations, our Bodies, our Souls, are all nothing, infinitely leſs then Nothing to the great God, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable.

               <p n="1">1. In that ſin is a <hi>breach</hi> of this incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable God's <hi>Law,</hi> a violation of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, a contradiction of his Will: <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſinneth, tranſgreſſeth the Law, for ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> 1 John 3.4.

It is ill to reproach a common man, worſe to reproach a Noble man, or a Prince; but O how bad is it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the great God! to blaſpheme that worthy Name: Sin layeth the honour of this incomparable God (which is more worth then millions of Worlds) in the duſt, and trampleth on it. The <hi>Romans</hi> when they would mark one with ignominy, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64652:102"/> brand him with reproach, would put him out of their Senate, or any place of Credit in which he was, and pull down his Statue or Monument, if any were erected to his Honour. Sin degrades and dethrones God, it will not allow him to be the Lord and Supreme of the World, and it defaceth his Image where-ever it finds it, as one contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expels another: It diſgraceth his Juſtice, thence is called <hi>

               <p>O how odious! how loathſome, how abominable is ſin, that breaks the Law, ſlights the Authority, diſhonors the Name, and to its utmoſt dethrones and deſtroys the Being of this incomparable God, this ſelf-ſufficient, independent, abſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, eternal, incomprehenſible, infinite Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which alone deſerves the name of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to which all other.

               <p>This, this is the venome, the malignity of ſin, that it is oppoſite and contrary, offenſive and injurious to the incomparable God. This is the conſideration which ſhould humble us moſt for our ſins: This was the weight that preſſed <hi>David</hi> down moſt, and laid him ſo low in the day of his Repentance; <hi>Againſt thee,</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> If God be incomparable, how great is the madneſs and miſery of impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?</head>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" n="2" unit="Ʋse"/>
               <p>SEcondly, if God be ſuch an incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable God, it informeth us of the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and miſery of Sinners.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of their <hi>madneſs in daring to offend</hi> him, and to contend with him. 2. In <hi>wilfully loſing</hi> this incomparable God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How great is their <hi>madneſs in daring to offend</hi> him? yea, in daring him to his face? Reader, if thou ſhouldſt ſee a man without any cauſe ſtriving with an whole Army, hacking and hewing, and provoking them to kill him, you would think ſurely the man is mad, otherwiſe he would never thus wilfully run himſelf into a certain ruine. I tell thee every time thou wilfully breakeſt his Laws, thou acteſt more like a diſtracted man; for thou fighteſt againſt that God who is ſtronger than millions of Armies, who is Almighty; and thou provokeſt him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thee who can wink thee into the other world, and look thee into the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64652:106"/> Lake, and hiſs thee into Hell flames. Man, art thou Gods match, that thou offereſt to enter the Liſt with him? <hi>Do ye</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>provoke the Lord to anger? Are ye ſtronger than he?</hi> 1 Cor. 10.22. It's one thing to provoke men to anger, and another thing to provoke the Lord to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Man hath but a little heart, and a ſmall hand; his anger and power cannot at utmoſt exceed finite; but Gods heart and hand, his anger and power are both infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. If the wrath of a King <hi>be a Meſſenger of Death,</hi> what thinkeſt thou is the wrath of immenſity, and the ſtroak of Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? What then is the wrath of a God? Sinner doſt thou know what thou doſt when thou breakeſt his Laws, ſlighteſt his Love, diſhonoureſt his Name, grieveſt his Spirit? I tell thee thou provokeſt a God who is incomparable in holineſs, and hath threatned thy deſtruction; who is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable in power, and can accompliſh what he hath threatned; and who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable in truth, and cannot but make good with his arm, what he hath ſpoken with his mouth: <hi>Wo be to him that ſtriveth with his Maker: let the Potſherds ſtrive with the Potſherds of the earth,</hi> Iſa. 45.1. God is
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64652:106"/> a <hi>God of Peace,</hi> he hates ſtrife; but if men will be ſtriving, he wiſheth them rather to meddle with thoſe that are their matches, poor ſilly worms like themſelves, and not to ſtrive with their Maker, who is infinitely their Superiour in authority and power, and every perfection. Here is ſawcineſs indeed, for a pitiful nothing to challenge Almightineſs to Battel. <hi>Who</hi> (in his wits, in his ſenſes, that were not quite diſtracted) <hi>would ſet Briars and Thorns againſt me in Battel? I would go through them, I would burn them up all together,</hi> Iſa. 27.4. <hi>Briars and Thorns</hi> are not match to a fire; how eaſily, how ſpeedily, how certainly doth the fire conſume them as ſoon as it layeth hold of them? how much leſs is weak man a match for God, who is a <hi>conſuming fire?</hi> When the <hi>Roman</hi> Poet was deſired to make Verſes againſt his Emperour, he anſwered, <hi>Nolo in eum ſcribere qui poteſt proſcribere, I'le not jeer and jeſt with him that can kill me in earneſt.</hi> Our Saviour tells us, <hi>What King going to war againſt another, ſitteth not down firſt, and conſulteth, whether he be able with</hi> 10000 <hi>to meet him that cometh againſt him with</hi> 20000? <hi>or elſe while the other is a great way off ſendeth to his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64652:107"/> and deſireth conditions of Peace,</hi> Luk. 14.31, 32. O that when the Devil and fleſh entice the Sinner to ſport with and make a mock of Sin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.23. he would but conſider, <hi>it's ill jeſting with edged tools,</hi> it's ill jeſting with unquenchable Burnings; for how <hi>can his heart endure, or his hands be ſtrong in the day that the great God ſhall deal with him?</hi> Ezek. 22.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, How great is their <hi>madneſs,</hi> who will <hi>venture the eternal loſs of this God,</hi> this incomparable God, for every baſe luſt? what a mad man is he, who will ſtake a Million againſt a Mite, a Crown againſt a Crum, Subſtance againſt Shadows, all things againſt nothing, the bleſſed bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God againſt a moments ſenſual delight. Was not <hi>Shimei</hi> bereft of his wits, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his life for a little uncertain worldly profit by his Servant? The Lord Jeſus doth moſt fitly call him a fool, who would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and loſe the incomparable God for a little corruptible Gold, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20. The Spirit of God ſpeaks the Prodigal to be <hi>beſide himſelf,</hi> when he left bread, bread enough, bread enough in his Fathers houſe, for husks, and not a Belly full nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and among Swine, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.18, 19, 20.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64652:107"/> and when <hi>he came to himſelf,</hi> he conſidered what a mad man he was, to wallow among Swine, and feed on ſuch bruitiſh fare, which could never fill his belly, when he might have been feaſting among the Children of God in his Fathers houſe, with plenty of what is bread indeed, able to ſatisfie a capacious Heaven-born Soul. Friend, think of it ſeriouſly, the next time thou art temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Sin, will this Oath, or this Cup, or this Theft, or this Wantonneſs, or this neglect of Duty ballance the everlaſting loſs of the incomparable God? will this luſt, this moments pleaſure make amends for the loſs of him who is eternal life, and a River of unconceivable and unchangeable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures? ſhall I be ſo beſotted, bewitched, diſtracted, as to loſe real mercies for <hi>lying vanities,</hi> the fountain of living waters for <hi>Broken Ciſterns,</hi> the food of Angels for the worlds ſcraps; a precious Soul, an ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Saviour, an incomparable God, for a toy, a trifle, a poor empty guilded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Did ever any in <hi>Bedlam</hi> buy ſo dear, or ſell ſo cheap, or manifeſt the like madneſs?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the <hi>miſery</hi> of Sinners. They ſhall loſe this incomparable God for ever; nay,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64652:108"/> they muſt have him for their everlaſting enemy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their <hi>miſery</hi> conſiſteth partly in this, that they muſt <hi>depart for ever</hi> from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable God, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Depart from me ye workers of iniquity.</hi> Math. 25.41. <hi>Depart from me ye curſed.</hi> O how dreadful a ſound will the word <hi>Depart</hi> make in the Sinners ears? yea, what a deep wound will it make in his heart? <hi>Depart from me;</hi> Ah! whether do they go, that go from God? To depart from riches and honours, and carnal comforts for ever, will affect and afflict him to purpoſe who placeth his happineſs in them; to loſe health, and liberty, and friends, and relations for ever, is no inconſiderable loſs to him that knoweth not where to have them made up. To loſe the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, ſeaſons of Grace, the tenders, intreaties, invitations of the Goſpel for ever, is ſuch a loſs that a ſenſualliſt is unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of conceiving the greatneſs of. To loſe the Communion of perfect Spirits, the company of glorious Angels, the bleſſed exerciſes of the Heavenly Hoſt for ever, will not a little affright and amaze, and vex and terrifie the wicked, when they once come to have their eyes opened, and their
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64652:108"/> Conſciences awakened in the other world: But to depart from the <hi>incomparable God</hi> for ever, to loſe the only Paradice of pleaſures, the only fountain of living Waters, the only author of true felicity; to loſe the unſearchable Mine of Riches, the inexhauſtable well of Salvation, the ineſtimable Sun of Righteouſneſs; to loſe the deareſt Father, the wiſeſt Guide, the ſtrongeſt Shield, the ſweeteſt Love, the cloſeſt Friend, the tendereſt Mercy, the richeſt Grace, the higheſt Honour, the only happineſs; to loſe the Lord of Life, the Lord of Glory, the Lord of Lords; to loſe the God of Hope, the God of all Grace, the God of all Conſolation, the God of Peace, the God of Gods, the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable God; and to loſe him totally and for ever, is the loſs of all loſſes, is ſuch a loſs as no tongue can declare, no mind can conceive, is ſuch a loſs as never was the like before it, nor ſhall, nor can be the like after it. He that hath loſt God, hath nothing left that is good, he hath loſt all that was worth having or ſaving. <hi>Lord whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall we go, if we go from thee? thou haſt the words of eternal life,</hi> Joh. 6.68.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:64652:109"/>
               <p>Reader, how great is the Sinners loſs in the other world, how great ſoever his gain is in this? Ah where <hi>is his hope though he hath gained, when God ſhall take away his Soul?</hi> Job 27.8. Can the greateſt gain Counter-ballance the loſs of him to whom the whole world, yea, millions of worlds are traſh and trifles?</p>
               <p>The greatneſs of any loſs is to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the excellency and value of that which we loſe; therefore if God be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable in all perfections, the loſs of Sinners, who loſe this God totally and eternally, muſt be an incomparable loſs. As there is no gain equal to the gain of a God, all other gains are but painted Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies or Butterflies to this; ſo there is no loſs equal to the loſs of a God, all other loſſes are but Bug-bears to fright Children with to this; this is a loſs with a witneſs, a loſs which nothing can countervail, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, or make up, in which all that is good is gone for ever. As <hi>Micah</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they asked him what he ayled to cry out ſo, <hi>Ye have taken away my God, and what have I more?</hi> Judg. 18.22. So will the Sinner in the other world, ſcreech horribly, and complain heavily of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64652:109"/> his deceitful Fleſh (which now he makes ſuch proviſion for) <hi>Thou haſt taken away my God, and what have I more? I am poor, a beggar, nothing worth, worſe than naught, wholly ruined, utterly undone by thee, I have loſt my God, and with him all that is good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, if thou liveſt without God, ponder, O ponder in the midſt of all thy gettings what thou art looſing; yea, what thou ſhalt looſe (if thou doſt not return) for ever and ever. Did the Diſciples weep and wail, that they ſhould ſee the face of a good man no more on earth, <hi>Sorrowing moſt of all, for the words that he ſpake unto them, that they ſhould ſee his face no more,</hi> Acts 20.38. And doſt thou think it will not fill thy heart with ſorrow, and cut it with anguiſh, to hear the bleſſed God, the incomparable God ſay to thee, <hi>Sinner, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, farewel for ever, thou ſhalt ſee my face no more for ever?</hi> Believe it, thoſe words will ſound more dolefully in thine ears, than thou art now aware of; they will be a Paſſing Bell to all thy hopes, and joyes, and comforts, and delights; they will be a knell to Toll the Death and Burial of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever may be refreſhing and reviving to thee, of all thine eaſe, and reſt, and liberty,

Now poſſibly thou canſt be merry enough without God, thou hadſt rather have his room than his company, preferreſt a life without him, before a life with him; and ſayeſt unto him, <hi>Depart from me, I deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes,</hi> Job 21.14. And the reaſon of this Atheiſm and Prophaneneſs, is thine ignorance; thou knoweſt not what a fountain of life, what bowels of love, what an hive of ſweetneſs, what an ocean of happineſs the bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable God is, neither believeſt what Scripture ſpeaks hereof: but when once thou entereſt into the other world, and haſt loſt this God irrecoverably, thou ſhalt know what thou haſt loſt; but then, if ever, that ſaying of the wiſe man will be verified, <hi>He that encreaſeth knowledge, encreaſeth ſorrow,</hi> Eccleſ. 1.18. And then thou ſhalt believe the truth of the glaſs of Scripture in its repreſentations of the beautiful face of God, though thy faith will be the faith of a Devil, to thy terror, and torment. Ah Sinner, when thou ſhalt know and believe what a vaſt treaſure, what a River of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,

Ah how wilt thou loath, and hate, and curſe thy ſelf for thy folly and madneſs? thou wilt gnaſh thy teeth for envy at them that ſit at Heavens Table, feaſting with the fruit of the <hi>tree of life,</hi> and drinking of the <hi>pure Rivers of water which flow from the throne of God, and the Lamb;</hi> and thou wilt weep and wail for thy own diſtraction, that thou ſhouldſt refuſe the offers of all thoſe dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and delicates, and delights, when they were made to thee in the day of thy life; that thou ſhouldſt ſhut thy own mouth, and wilfully refuſe all thoſe rich and coſtly Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, and ſhut the door of heaven and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs againſt thee with thine own hands. Ah Sinner, little, little doſt thou know at the preſent what it is to loſe this God. Other loſſes may be corrective, but this is <hi>deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive;</hi> God whips in others, but he <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:64652:111"/> in this; Other loſſes may be the part of his Children, but this is the <hi>Portion of Devils.</hi> All joy, all comfort is ſtab'd to the heart, pierced through, the heart blood of it is let out with this one word (ſharper than any two-edged Sword) <hi>Depart. Write this man comfortleſs</hi> (as it was ſaid of one <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.) <hi>ult. a man that ſhall not proſper all his dayes.</hi> Write this poor Soul comfortleſs, a Soul that ſhall not have a bit of bread, a drop of water, a glimpſe of light, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments eaſe, or crum of comfort, all the long day of eternity. Ah Friend, think of it betimes, <hi>Woe be to thee if God depart from thee,</hi> Hoſ. 9.12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their miſery conſiſteth in this alſo, that they ſhall have this <hi>incomparable God for their enemy.</hi> As there is no friend like God, and therefore their privative miſery muſt be great, exceeding great, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably great; ſo there is no enemy like God, and therefore the poſitive miſery of Sinners muſt be matchleſs and beyond all compariſons. The greater any ones power and anger are, the greater their miſery is who fall under the ſtroak of that power, and the force of that anger. God is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable in power, he worketh arbitrarily,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:64652:111"/> irreſiſtably, omnipotently; he hath a mighty and an almighty arm: God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable in anger, his anger roots up, pulls down, kills, makes horrid ſlaughters, removeth the mountains, ſhaketh the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the earth, is a conſuming fire, burning and waſting all that comes near it. <hi>Thou, even thou art to be feared,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 90.</note> 
                  <hi>for none may ſtand when thou art angry.</hi> Woe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to them that have this God for their Enemy; it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> choſe rather to fall into the hands of God than men, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.14. becauſe he was a child of God (though afflicted ſharply by him; for love can conſiſt with anger, though not with hatred) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired, ſince he muſt be ſcourged, to be whipt by a loving Father (who would conſider his ſtrength (what he could bear) as well as his fault and offence, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly uſe his rod) rather than by a cruel enemy, who hated him, and had not the leaſt mercy or pity for him. Beſide, this world is the Stage whereon the mercy of God acteth its part (Juſtice muſt have its courſe and ſolemn triumph in the other world.) He is here <hi>good to all,</hi> his Sun
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64652:112"/> ſhineth, and Rain falleth upon the juſt and unjuſt, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 145.9. <hi>Math.</hi> 5.45. Therefore it's better for any man upon earth to fall into the hands of God, than the beſt Friend or neareſt Relation in the world. But the Sinner is the object only of Gods wrath, of his hatred, of his abhorrency, after death; God then puts off all pity, all tenderneſs, all bowels towards him; and the other world is the place wherein his Juſtice (that is now clouded and eclipſed) ſhall ſhine forth in its full force and ſtrength, and appear in all its beauty and brightneſs. And therefore it muſt of neceſſity be a fearful thing for a poor creature to fall into the hands of the living God; to have nothing but his naked fleſh, his own weak Soul, to bear the ſtroak of infinite power, ſet on and urged to ſtrike home, by infinite anger, and that for ever.</p>
               <p>All the wrackings and torturings, the extream pains and aches, the violent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions and conſternations, the dreadful horror and anguiſh, the everlaſting chains of darkneſs, the never dying worm, and the fire that never goeth out of the Devils and damned, are but the expreſſions and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64652:112"/> fruits of the matchleſs power and anger of this incomparable God. Therefore they are called <hi>Wrath, Rom.</hi> 2.4. the <hi>wrath of God,</hi> John 3. <hi>ult.</hi> and <hi>wrath to come,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1. <hi>ult.</hi> Reader, think of it; if the <hi>wrath of a King,</hi> (a man like thy ſelf, though cloathed with more civil power and ſtrength) be as <hi>the roaring of a Lyon</hi> (which makes all the Beaſts of the Forreſt to quake and tremble, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6.<note place="margin">Prov. 10.12.</note>) what then is the wrath of an <hi>Almighty infinite God?</hi> If he wound his friends, the objects of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal choice, the travail of his Beloved Sons Soul, thoſe on whom he intendeth to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the riches of his love and grace for ever (in the day of his anger, for their diſobedience) with the wound of <hi>an enemy,</hi> yea, with <hi>the wounds of a cruel one,</hi> Jer. 30.14. if he break their bones, and cauſe the Arrow of his Quiver to enter into their Reins; if he fill their Souls with bitterneſs, and make them drunk with wormwood; if he makes them water their Couches with Tears, and go mourning all the day long; if his anger cauſeth them to roar unceſſantly, and his terrors make them diſtracted; if he be to them as a Bear lying in wait, and as a Lyon
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64652:113"/> in ſecret places; How will he wound thee his enemy? how will he deal with thee whom he infinitely hateth? what a Bear, what a Lyon, what a Fire will he be to thee? how unable wilt thou be to ſtand under, and yet how impoſſible to avoid the weight of his Omnipotent arm and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite anger?

                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> If God be incomparable, how monſtrous is their Pride who compare themſelves to the incomparable God.</head>
               <p>THirdly, If God be ſuch an incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God, it informeth us, what <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Pride and deſperate preſumption</hi> they are guilty <hi>of, who compare with, and prefer themſelves before</hi> this God. If he be ſo tranſcendently excellent in his Being, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, Word, and Works; how deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſaucy and impudent are they who put themſelves in the ballance with God? <hi>Behold all Nations to me are as nothing, yea, leſs than nothing, and vanity: To whom then will ye liken me? or to what will ye compare me?</hi> Iſa. 40.17, 18. To liken God to any is the groſſeſt Idolatry, and to liken any to God is the higheſt arrogancy. <hi>Babylon</hi> that ſets her ſelf <hi>in the Throne of God, and exalteth her ſelf above all that is called God,</hi> is the <hi>myſterie of iniquity,</hi> the man of Sin, in truth the dregs of the very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.9. It's a debaſing God, not to adore him, and admire him according to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64652:114"/> his excellent Majeſty, and vaſt immenſity; what a debaſing then is it of God to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him to poor pitiful nothings, as all Men and Angels are to him? He debaſeth himſelf to open his eyes upon men, upon Angels, to behold things that are done in <hi>Heaven and Earth, Pſ.</hi> 113.5. But he will not debaſe himſelf to compare with Men and Angels, he ſcorneth to put himſelf into the Scales with them, he is infinitely above and beyond all Comparatives, all Superlatives. <hi>Compariſons</hi> (we ſay) <hi>are odious;</hi> but no compariſon that ever was, hath in the leaſt degree that odiouſneſs which this hath, for a Man or an Angel to compare with their <hi>Maker.</hi> The ſlime, and clay, and earth, may very much better compare with the Potter; both are narrow limited beings, both are earth and clay; yet the Potter would think it a great diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him, (who hath a body curiouſly wrought, and an Heaven-born ſpiritual immortal ſoul) and deſperate arrogancy in the clay and dirt which he trampleth on, to compare with him. And is it not greater pride in man to compare with God, when there is an infinite diſtance between them in all things? yet ſo ambitious and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64652:114"/> is man, that he dares to do this. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and <hi>Adam</hi> both aſpired to equal their Maker, they would needs be independent and ſelf-ſufficient, they endeavoured to cut off the entail, and to hold wholly and only of themſelves; but they ruin'd themſelves, and made themſelves baſer than beaſts, by aſpiring thus to raiſe themſelves to that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible pitch of a Partnerſhip with God.</p>
               <p>It's a favour, that Men and Angels may be like God in ſome rayes and beams of his holineſs and purity; but it's impoſſible for Men or Angels to be like God in the rich Jewels of his Crown, his independency, abſolute perfection, ſelf-ſufficiency, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſupremacy. He ſtampt ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of himſelf upon his creatures, but he took no impreſſions of his creatures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf; if they were made in his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he was not made in their likeneſs; it is deviliſh impudency and blaſphemy, for the higheſt Creature to weigh with the Creator. This was <hi>Lucifer</hi>'s pride, <hi>I will aſcend into Heaven, I will exalt my Throne above the Stars, I will be like the moſt High,</hi> Iſa. 14.13, 14. But his pride got a fall, and a ſhrewd one too. God cannot brook a Rival, he cannot bear an equal, there muſt
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64652:115"/> be but <hi>one Sun in the Heavens.</hi> A Prince may take it kindly from his Subjects, if they endeavour to imitate him, in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, juſtice, temperance, chaſtity, and in thoſe things that are general and common to him and them; becauſe hereby his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects honour him, (for by their imitation of him, they acknowledge excellency in him) but if his Subjects ſhall undertake to imitate him in his <hi>regalia,</hi> thoſe things that are proper to him as a King, ſhould they aſpire to make Laws, to make Peace and War, to wear the Crown, ſway the Scepter, and aſcend the Throne, he could not bear it, but would judge them Rebels guilty of High Treaſon, and worthy of death; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hereby they extreamly diſhonour him, <hi>viz.</hi> in making themſelves equal to him, and robbing him of that Superiority which God hath given him: So God is pleaſed and delighted that Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſhould reſemble him in thoſe perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his, that are common and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable; as to be patient, and meek, and loving, and righteous, and heavenly, and holy; becauſe hereby they glorifie him, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.16. But if the creatures ſhould go about to be like him in the <hi>peculiar Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſances</hi>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:64652:115"/> of the Deity, his Self-ſufficiency, Independency, Governing others at their will, Enacting Laws to oblige the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of others, exacting Worſhip from their fellow Creatures; ſo God cannot, God will not ſuffer it, for hereby they go about to rob him of his Supremacy, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne and ungod him. How often doth God tell us in Scripture, to quel ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous thoughts, that he is not mans fellow, mans familiar? <hi>God is not a man,</hi> Numb. 23.29. <hi>I am God, and not man,</hi> Hoſ. 11.9. <hi>He is not a man as I am,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job</hi> 9.32 v. Though God was pleaſed out of his infinite grace to become man, that man might once more be like God in thoſe communicable properties foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; yet he will not permit it, nay, it is altogether impoſſible, for man to become God, and be like him in the ſpecial prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of the Deity: There is ſtill an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diſtance between the divine and the humane nature. They who prate of being Godded, and turned into the eſſence of the Deity (as ſome have impudently and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly written) are either intollerably weak, or deviliſhly wicked, or both. Now becauſe many are guilty of the ſtrange pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64652:116"/> to compare with God, who little think it, I ſhall very briefly name two or three ſorts of men.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as quarrel with the <hi>Precepts</hi> of God, as if they were too ſtrict, too preciſe, too pure, and that God commanded more than was needful, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. This is a comparing with God, yea, a preferring our ſelves before God; and ſuch ſpeak as if they would be in Gods Throne to make Laws, and as if they would enact better Laws, more conducing to, and convenient for the welfare of mankind. Becauſe man hath vitiated his nature, and diſtempered all his faculties, he is angry at God for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning him a ſtrict diet, and forbidding him what would feed his Diſeaſe. <hi>A foul Stomach loatheth the wholſomeſt food.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When men queſtion the <hi>Providences</hi> of God, as if they were not good, and wiſe, and righteous, theſe compare, yea, prefer themſelves before God; their voice is like <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s, <hi>O that I were Judge, things ſhould not go thus at ſix and ſevens; See here is none to do juſtice to you; O that I governed the world, there ſhould be no ſuch diſorders as are now, no ſuch inequality amongſt men, The righteous ſhould not periſh, nor the wicked
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64652:116"/> flouriſh as they do:</hi> Theſe wayes are not equal, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.13, 17. Theſe men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with God for Soveraignty: <hi>Why ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt thou with him?</hi> Job 3.13. Theſe men accuſe God of folly, and think themſelves wiſer; <hi>but ſhall he that contendeth with God inſtruct him?</hi> Job 40.2. He that complains of Gods dealings, undertakes to teach God in what manner and by what means the world ſhould be better governed: Theſe men compare with God for juſtice; nay, condemn him of injuſtice, <hi>Job</hi> 40.8. <hi>Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayeſt be Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gods wayes are often ſecret, his pathes <hi>are in the Seas,</hi> and his goings <hi>in deep waters, Pſal.</hi> 73.19. and becauſe men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>fathom</hi> them, therefore they find fault with them. He writes his mind often in ſhort-hand, in dark Characters; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe poor blind man cannot read them, therefore he wrangleth with them, <hi>Thy Judgments are a great deep,</hi> Pſa. 36.9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When men tax the <hi>Decrees</hi> of God, as if they were unrighteous, partial, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with reſpect of perſons, they then compare with God, as if, in caſe they had been at Heavens Council-Table when all
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64652:117"/> things were debated and concluded, there ſhould have been more mild and moderate, more juſt and righteous reſolves and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions. Theſe men think and ſpeak evil of the things they underſtand not; and it would become them better to mind Faith and Repentance, and enſure their effectual Calling, than pry into or meddle with thoſe ſecrets of Heaven. No man hath a line long enough to meaſure God by; his eternal works and wayes are beyond all our underſtandings and apprehenſions, and ſo much fitter for our admiration than cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſquiſition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.17, <hi>to</hi> 24.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Once more, Thoſe Princes, or Maſters, or Parents, which command what God forbids, or forbid what God commands, compare with God, and uſurp his authority; for their power to command, &amp; right to be obey'd, muſt (in their conceits) be equal to Gods, or elſe why do they give Laws in oppoſition to his? or how can they expect to be obey'd? They who command divine worſhip to Bread and Wine, and places, or any creature, compare with and prefer themſelves before God: which is deſperate pride and preſumption, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.9, 10, 11. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.28.</p>

               <p>FOurthly, If God be an incomparable God, then <hi>incomparable Service and Worſhip is due to him.</hi> All ſervice muſt be ſutable to its object. The higher the Prince, the higher honour he doth and may expect. The Heathen were ſenſible of this, that ſuch worſhip muſt be given to their Deities as was ſuitable to them; therefore the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> who worſhipped the Sun, offered to him a <hi>flying horſe,</hi> noting ſtrength and ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; becauſe the Sun was ſtrong to run his race. God is a great God, and therefore muſt have great worſhip. <hi>Solomon</hi> gives this reaſon why the Temple, the place of Gods worſhip, muſt be great, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.3. <hi>The Houſe which I build is great</hi> (why?) <hi>for great is our God above all Gods.</hi> A great Palace is moſt ſuitable and becoming a great Prince. It reflects upon God, it's a ſlighting him, to give him any thing that is ordinary; as it is to a King to be put off with common entertainment at the houſes of his Subjects. As he is the beſt, ſo
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:64652:118"/> he will be ſerved with the beſt. <hi>Curſed be the deceiver; who hath in his ſtock a Male, and offereth to the Lord a corrupt thing.</hi> Why, what is the matter, that there muſt be ſuch care about, and choice of his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices? God himſelf gives you the reaſon, and a good reaſon for it, <hi>For I am a great King, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, and my name is dreadful among the Heathen,</hi> Mal. 1.10. Petty Princes may be owned and ſerved with petty Preſents; but a great King, a great Soveraign, muſt have great Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
               <p>When the Prophet had deſcribed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable excellency of God, how all Nations were to him as the leaſt <hi>drop in a Bucket</hi> to the Ocean, and the <hi>ſmall duſt</hi> in the ballance to the whole earth, as <hi>nothing and leſs than nothing,</hi> he preſently infers, Lebanon <hi>is not ſufficient to burn, nor all the Beaſts thereof for a burnt offering,</hi> Iſaiah 40.15, 16, 17. <hi>Lebanon</hi> abounded in all Spices for incenſe and perfumes, and in Cattle for Sacrifices and Burnt Offerings; but all the Spices and perfumes there, all the Beaſts and Cattle there, were below, and inſufficient for ſo incomparable a Being: he is ſo great that no ſervice can be great enough for him.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:64652:118"/>1.

The greater diſtance between any perſons, the greater reverence is expected. The Husband is the head of the Wife, therefore ſhe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>reverence her Husband,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> There is a great civil diſtance between Maſters and Servants, therefore the command runs, <hi>Servants be obedient to your Maſters with fear and trembling,</hi> Eph. 6.5. But now between God and us there is an infinite diſtance, and therefore there ought to be (if it were poſſible) infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite reverence, (he is ſo vaſtly above and beyond all others in excellency, that he alone deſerves the name of excellency) therefore his name is holy and reverend, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.10. and he is to be greatly feared. The greateſt excellency calleth for the greateſt reverence. <hi>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praiſed, he is to be feared above all Gods,</hi> Pſal. 96.4. This uſe <hi>David</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:64652:119"/> makes of Gods incomparableneſs, <hi>Who in the Heavens can be compared to the Lord? who among the Sons of the mighty can be likened to the Lord?</hi> What then? what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth on this? <hi>God is greatly to be feared in the aſſembly of his Saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are round about him,</hi> Pſal. 89.6, 7. Becauſe in our whole converſations we muſt walk with God, therefore we are commanded <hi>to be in the fear of the Lord all the day long,</hi> Prov. 23.17. But becauſe in Ordinances we have more immediately and ſpecially to do with him (then we are ſaid <hi>to appear before him,</hi> Pſal. 42.2.) therefore we are bound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be moſt aweful and reverential. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhew moſt reverence in the preſence Chamber of their Soveraign. O with what awe and dread ſhould mortals appear in the preſence of him who <hi>inhabiteth eternity!</hi> ſhould duſt and aſhes draw nigh to the <hi>mighty Poſſeſſor of heaven and earth?</hi> Eccl. 5.1, 2. <hi>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the houſe of God, and be more ready to hear than to give the Sacrifice of Fools; be not raſh with thy mouth, let not thine heart be haſty to utter any thing before God</hi> (but why all this care and caution?) <hi>for God is in

(All over Majeſty) <hi>therefore let all the earth ſtand in awe of him.</hi> He is adorned, ſurrounded with Majeſty, therefore we muſt be filled with the awe of him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.10, 19, 20. <hi>Fear and Majeſty</hi> are three times conjoyned. His incomparable power calls for incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reverence. Power is aweful; and the greater the power is, the greater awe is required, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Fear not them that can kill the Body, and can do no more; but fear him who is able to caſt Soul and Body into Hell.</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid, I know you are of timerous ſpirits, and men of fearful tempers, ye are apt to tremble, and to be frighted at every thing; well I will direct you, how you may make this paſſion advantagious to you, <hi>viz.</hi> by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſtream into its proper channel, by placing your fear on its proper object; I will tell you of one worthy of your fear, who deſerveth to be feared, So <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4, 5. <hi>I will forewarn you whom ye ſhall fear,</hi> (I will offer you an object meet for your fear) <hi>Fear him, who after he hath killed,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:64652:120"/> hath power to caſt into hell; yea, I ſay unto you, fear him.</hi> You are apt like Children to be frighted with Bug-bears, and to dread them that can onely raze the Skin, and pinch the Fleſh, and at the moſt can but take from you a life that will fall of it ſelf within a few dayes: well I'le adviſe you whom to ſtand in awe of, fear him that can kill you and damn you, that can ſend your bodies to the grave, and your ſouls to unquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble flames; <hi>yea, I ſay unto you, fear him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This incomparable God, calls for <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable humility, and lowlineſs of Spirit from us.</hi> The height of God muſt lay man low, and the matchleſs excellency of God make him baſe in his own eyes. When we behold our ſelves in the Glaſs of thoſe that have little or nothing that is good or praiſe-worthy, or that have leſs than our ſelves, then we ſpread out our plumes, and are puft up with pride, and judge our ſelves comely creatures; but if we would behold our ſelves in the glaſs of the <hi>Incomparable God, in whoſe ſight the Heavens are unclean, in whoſe preſence Angels vail their faces,</hi> to whom ten thouſand Suns are perfect dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all the world leſs than nothing; how ſhould we pluck in our plumes, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:64652:120"/> our ſelves for our pride. Man never comes to a right knowledge of himſelf, what a pitiful abominable wretch he is, till he comes to a right knowledge of God, what an excellent incomparable Majeſty he is. As when men ſtand high, and look downward on thoſe below them, that are meaner and viler than themſelves, their heads are <hi>giddy,</hi> and ſwim with conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they then are <hi>ſome body</hi> in their own opinions; but when they look upwards to the Great God, the Sun, the Soul, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all worth and excellency, that Meagrum or high-mindedneſs is prevented. The beſt men upon a ſight of God, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable God (though the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent he is, the more cauſe they have of joy, in having ſo rich a portion, yet) inſtead of loving, have loathed themſelves, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of admiring, have abhor'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. When <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaw the God of glory ſitting on his Throne, in his brightneſs and beauty, encircled with Millions of coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Courtiers, covering their faces, (as aſhamed of their drops in the preſence of the Ocean) and crying <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> (as apprehending his purity beyond all their expreſſions, and his perfections ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:64652:121"/> all their apprehenſions) what thoughts had he of himſelf! O what a poor pitiful contemptible creature did he think himſelf? yea, what an uncomely, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, abominable creature was he in his own eye? <hi>Woe to me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am undone, I am a man of unclean lips, for mine eyes have ſeen the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Iſa. 6.4, 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This incomparable God calls for <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable love,</hi> the top, the cream of our affections. Good is the object of Love. <hi>Amor eſt complacentia boni,</hi> according to the Moraliſts; the greater therefore the good is, the greater love it requireth; and God being the greateſt good, muſt have the greateſt love. This is the great and firſt command, <hi>Math.</hi> 22.37. this is (as I may ſay) the only command, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12. this is all the commands in one, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10. Love is the Decalogue contracted; and the Decalogue is love opened, and explained. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, with all thy ſtrength, with all thy mind,</hi> Math. 22.37. God being the greateſt perfection, muſt have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt affection. The greateſt love (for God is Love, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.8.). calls for the greateſt love. He deſerves the greateſt <hi>extenſively,</hi>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:64652:121"/> the heart, ſoul, mind, ſtrength; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <hi>intenſively,</hi> all the heart, all the ſoul, all the mind, all the ſtrength. Reader, thy love to him muſt be ſo great, that thy love to thy father, mother, wife, child, houſe, land, and life, muſt be <hi>hatred</hi> in compariſon of it, and in competition with it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26. The truth is, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy of our love like God; nay, there is nothing worthy of our love beſide God. All our Friends, and Relations, and Eſtates, and worldly Bleſſings, are nothing lovely, but as they are his creatures, his comforts, inſtruments for his glory, and as they have relation to him: Nay, Sabbaths, Sacraments, ſeaſons of grace, are no more lovely than as they are his inſtitutes, and means of communion with his Majeſty. <hi>I love the habitation of thy houſe</hi> (why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe) <hi>it is the place where thine honour dwelleth,</hi> Pſal. 28.8. Once more; grace it ſelf is not lovely, but as it's the image and conformity unto, the pleaſure and delight of, that which fitteth and maketh meet for the love, embraces, and fruition of this incomparable God. Deſire and Delight are the two acts of love, diſtinguiſhed only by the abſence or preſence of the object.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64652:122"/> When the object beloved is abſent, the ſoul acts towards it in deſire: When the object is preſent, the ſoul acteth towards it in delight. The former is the motion, the latter the reſt and repoſe of the ſoul. Now the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable God muſt have incomparable deſires, panting, Pſal. 42.2. longing, yea fainting, out of vehemency of deſire, Pſal. 119.20, 40, 80. God muſt be deſired above all, Pſal. 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſide thee.</hi> The Incomparable God muſt have incomparable delight. <hi>I will go to the Altar of God my joy, of God my exceeding joy,</hi> Pſal. 43.4. The ſoul muſt be raviſhed, extaſied in the preſence and enjoyment of God, <hi>Cantic.</hi> 2.4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Incomparable God muſt have <hi>incomparable truſt.</hi> The more able and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful any perſon is, the more firmly we truſt him. Now God is incomparable in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he hath an <hi>Almighty arm;</hi> incomparable in faithfulneſs, he <hi>cannot lie,</hi> Tit. 1.2. <hi>It's impoſſible for him to lie,</hi> Heb. 6.18. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God muſt have our ſureſt love, and firmeſt faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. We muſt eſteem his words as good as deeds; and rely on all he promiſeth, as if it were
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:64652:122"/> already performed. We muſt not ſtagger or waver, but <hi>draw nigh to him with full aſſurance of faith,</hi> Heb. 10.22. His bonds muſt be lookt upon (for they are as good) as ready money; and we muſt rejoyce in hope of the good things promiſed, as if we had them in hand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2, 3.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This incomparable God muſt have <hi>incomparable obedience</hi> in the whole courſe of our lives. The more vertuous, or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, or honourable, or excellent, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is with whom we walk, the more we weigh our words, and ponder the paths of our feet, and watch over our ſelves. God is incomparable in purity, in jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, in Majeſty, in excellency; therefore they who are ever under his eye, and in his preſence, and who walk with him, muſt walk (not as they do when with ordinary perſons, careleſly and negligently, but) <hi>circumſpectly,</hi> accurately, exactly, to an hairs breadth, as on a ridge, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Eph. 5.15. His law muſt be kept (to a tittle, in every punctilio) as <hi>the apple of the eye,</hi> Prov. 7.2. which is offended with the leaſt mote of duſt. And this obedience muſt be not only at ſome ſeaſons, and in ſome acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but always, and in all things. <hi>As he
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64652:123"/> who hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15.</p>
               <p>All our ſervice to this incomparable God muſt be incomparable. Little ſervice is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to a great God, 1 Chron. 29.1, 2. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> the King ſaid unto all the Congregation, <hi>Solomon</hi> my Son, whom alone God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, is yet young and tender, and the work (i. e. of building the temple) is great; for the Palace is not for man, but for the Lord God. Now I have prepared with all my might for the houſe of my God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, If God be an incomparable God, it informeth us of his <hi>infinite grace and condeſcention,</hi> to take ſo much notice of, and do ſo much for man. The height of the Perſon that beſtoweth a favour, and the meanneſs and unworthineſs of the object on whom it is beſtowed, doth exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advance and heighten the grace and goodneſs of him that doth it. O what grace is it then for the moſt high, the God of heaven, the God whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain, to manifeſt ſuch reſpect to vile ſinful duſt and aſhes, yea, to them that are rebels and Traytors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Majeſty, and thereby worthy of Hell. <hi>David</hi> admireth it, and is amazed at it, Pſal. 8.1. <hi>O Lord, our Lord, how excellent
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64652:123"/> is thy name in all the earth! and thy glory is above the heavens.</hi> What followeth? <hi>What is man that thou art mindful of him, or the ſon of man that thou viſiteſt him?</hi> That God, the excellent God, the God famous in all the earth, the God glorious above the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, ſhould mind man, poor ſilly ſimple man, weak frail dying man, ſinful filthy polluted man, loſt wretched miſerable man, could not but affect the heart of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> with admiration and aſtoniſhment. <hi>What is man that thou art mindful of him?</hi> He is altogether below thy thoughts, and unworthy to be a moment in thy mind: Or <hi>the Son of man that thou viſiteſt him?</hi> he doth not deſerve to be viſited by the beaſts of the earth, much leſs to be viſited by the Angels of Heaven, and leaſt of all by the God of heaven; He may well ſay as the Centurion, <hi>Lord I am unworthy that thou ſhouldſt come under my roof, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought I my ſelf worthy to come unto thee,</hi> Mat. 8.8. <hi>David wonders that</hi> God ſhould mind man ſo much as to make the heavens, and thoſe glorious Lamps there, for his uſe and comfort: <hi>When I conſider the heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the ſtars which thou haſt made; what is
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64652:124"/> man that thou art mindful of him?</hi> But how much more cauſe had he to wonder, that the heaven of heavens, the God of heaven, the Sun of righteouſneſs, the light of lights, ſhould do ſo much, and be ſo much him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the good and comfort of man?</p>
               <p>God doth manifeſt much grace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention in taking ſuch care of <hi>mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> and <hi>outward concerns.</hi> You would think it a great grace and condeſcention in a King, to take care night and day of a poor beggar, to ſee to it himſelf (and not to leave it to ſervants or any others) that he have food, and raiment, and liberty, and peace, and ſafety every day, that his bed be made well and eaſie for him every night, that when he is ſick he have phyſick, &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, and tendance, and ſhould conſtantly viſit him himſelf in perſon, that in all his wants he be ſupplyed, in all his weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſupported, in all his dangers defended, and in all his diſtreſſes delivered; If this King ſhould never ſtir from this beggar, but do all this in his own perſon; if he himſelf ſhould ſpread his table, and provide his food, and be at the ſole charge of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and put them on, and make his bed, and ſtand by him all night while he ſlept,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:64652:124"/> to prevent any evil that might befall him, and go up and down with him all day to protect him, and counſel him, and relieve him, as occaſion required, you would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at the favour and kindneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention of this Prince. Believe it Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (ſurely ſeeing is believing) <hi>the King of Kings</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> he whoſe name is <hi>I am,</hi> he to whom all the Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Potentates of the world, are droſs and dirt and dung, the Incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God doth more than all this, very much more for thee every day and every night, and that in his own perſon: He ſendeth thee all thy bread, and drink, and cloaths, and makes them refreſhing to thee; he provides thy habitation, and lodging, and commandeth ſleep for thee; He is with thee continually in all thy out-goings, incomings, to preſerve thee alive, to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee to thy motions, to ſucceed thy lawful undertakings, to relieve thee in thy neceſſities, and to defend thee from all thine Adverſaries. And is not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention worthy of all admiration? O what grace is it, that the incomparable God, who hath millions of glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels waiting on him, and ten thouſand
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64652:125"/> times ten thouſand, always miniſtring to him ſhould thus wait on, and watch over poor crawling worms, night and day for good, Act. 7.2. Job. 7.20. Pſal. 4. ult. Hoſea 2.8. Gen. 32.9, 10, 11. Pſal. 34.3, 4, 5. Heb. 1.3. Pſal. 145.5, 7. <hi>Job</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that God ſhould condeſcend to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect man for his faults. <hi>What is man that thou doſt magnifie him, that thou ſetteſt thine heart upon him, that thou viſiteſt him every morning?</hi> &amp;c. Job. 7.17, 18. How much then doth God condeſcend to be his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant guide and guard, to keep him night and day leaſt any hurt him? O the grace of this God! This incomparable God doth much more magnifie his grace and condeſcention in the care he is pleas'd to take of mens precious ſouls: Herein he ſheweth the riches of his mercy, the <hi>excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abundant riches of his grace,</hi> Eph. 2.5. and 7. Reader, is it not condeſcending grace in the higheſt degree, nay beyond all degrees, for this ſelf-ſufficient, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfect, incomparable God, when the ſoul of man lay naked, ſtarving, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, encompaſs'd with enemies, unpittied of all creatures, weltring in its blood, gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for breath, ready every moment to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64652:125"/> fetch its laſt, and to be ſiezed on by Divels drag'd to their Dungeon of darkneſs, there to fry in untollerable flames for ever; for him to look on man in this loathſom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with an eye of favour and love, to cloath it with the <hi>righteouſneſs of a God,</hi> to feed it with that fleſh which is <hi>meat indeed,</hi> and with that blood which is <hi>drink indeed,</hi> to give it reſt in his own bowels and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, to bind up its wounds, and raiſe it from the dead, and make it free from the ſlavery of Satan, and his bondage to ſin, and death, and hell, and to adopt it for his own child, accept it as perfectly righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, marry it to his onely begotten, <hi>the heir of all things,</hi> dwell in it by his own bleſſed Spirit, and carry it on eagles wings, and conduct it ſafe through the wilderneſs of the world, and in ſpight of all the Lyons and wolves and ſerpents and adders and Giants and <hi>Anachims</hi> and <hi>Canaanites</hi> that oppoſed it, to bring it to an heavenly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> to fulneſs of joy, and rivers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and crowns of life, and weights of glory, there to reign in and with his own incomparable Majeſty for ages, generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, millions of ages, yea unto all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Friend, friend, what is condeſcending
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64652:126"/> grace, if this be not? Alas the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable God had no obligation to man, he ſtood in no way need of man, he is unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the leaſt good by man; he would have been as happy as he is at preſent, if the Race of mankind had been ruin'd and had periſhed: Beſides, he was infinitely disobliged by man, and had all the reaſon in the world to deſtroy him; and yet he is pleaſed to be as ſtudious of mans welfare, and as ſolicitous about it, as if it had been his own. <hi>Abigail</hi> wondred that <hi>David</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted to a Kingdom ſhould take her to be his wife, ſhe ſcarce judged her ſelf wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to waſh the feet of his ſervants, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.41. Mayſt not thou wonder more that the incomparable God ſhould marry thee to himſelf, who art unworthy to be his ſervant? <hi>David</hi> admired that God ſhould do ſo much for him: haſt thou not cauſe to ſay as he did, <hi>Lord, what am I, and what is my Fathers houſe, that thou haſt brought me up hitherto,</hi> pardoned, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, renewed me, taken me into thy own Family! and yet, as if this were a ſmall thing in thy ſight, thou <hi>ſpeakeſt of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants houſe for a great while to come,</hi> thou art pleaſed to ſpeak of thy ſervant for
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64652:126"/> an everlaſting kingdom of honour and pleaſure, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18. And this conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending grace, or gracious condeſcention, is much the more admirable, if we conſider the means by which this great work of mans recovery was effected. The incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable God that is ſo great, ſo high, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all bounds, beyond all underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, becomes a weak weary hungry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible man. Reader, here is amazing condeſcenſion: The <hi>Lord of all</hi> becomes a ſervant, the <hi>Lord of glory</hi> becomes of no reputation, the <hi>bread of Life</hi> is hungry, and the only <hi>reſt</hi> is weary, and the <hi>Prince of life</hi> is put to death. This is that which Angels pry into with ſuch aſtoniſhing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that God ſhould become man, the Lawgiver be made under the Law, he that tempteth no man to evil, neither can be tempted to evil, ſhould be violently tempted many days together by all the powers of darkneſs, the only bleſſing ſhould be made a curſe, that Liberty ſhould be in bonds, and truth itſelf belied, and juſtice condemned, and heaven be layd in the belly of the earth. This is marvelous grace indeed, ſuch as <hi>paſseth all knowledge,</hi> Eph. 3.18, 19. If all the glorious Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64652:127"/> and Seraphims, Angels and Arch-angels, had condeſcended to have been turned into Toads and Serpents, it had not been by the thouſandth part ſo great a condeſcention, as for the incomparable God to become man: for, thoſe Heavenly Spirits, and Toads and Serpents, do <hi>convenire in ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo tertio,</hi> meet in the Genus of Creatures; there is but a finite difference between the former and the latter. But God and Man meet in no Third, in no Genus, between them there is an infinite diſtance. There never was, there never ſhall be, there never can be the like condeſcenſion.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Study the <hi>knowledge</hi> of this God, who is ſo incomparable. We are all ambitious to be acquainted with perſons that are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and excellent in place, or power, or parts, or piety, and judge it our intereſt, and an honour to us ſo to be. If we could hear of one as ſtrong as <hi>Sampſon,</hi> whom no cords could hold, who could ſlay hundreds with a Jaw-bone; or of one as old as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſelah,</hi> who could tell us what was done in many Centuries of years; or of one as wiſe as <hi>Solomon,</hi> who could ſpeak to the nature of all creatures, and anſwer the hardeſt Queſtions we could put to him; or of one as Holy as <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, or the elect Angels, who never broke the law of their Maker, but were as pure and perfect as when they came immediately out of his hands: How ſhould we throng, and thruſt,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64652:128"/> and crowd to ſuch men? what pains ſhould we take? what coſt ſhould we be at to obtain the favour and honour of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance? Surely (we ſhould think) we could never view them enough, or value them enough, or know enough of them, or diſcourſe enough with them: But alas, what are ſuch men (if we could find them in the world) to the bleſſed God? what motes, what drops, what poor pitiful No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things? what is a ſtrong <hi>Sampſon</hi> to the <hi>Almighty God,</hi> but as ſtraw, as chaff, as rotten wood, as all weakneſs? what is the Age of <hi>Methuſelah</hi> to the duration of the eternal God (to whoſe Age Millions of years add not a moment) but as a minute, as nothing? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.5.

Do men beat their brains, and conſume their bodies, and waſte their eſtates, and deny themſelves the pleaſures of the fleſh (as many Heathen have done) for the knowledge of nature, of the heavenly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and their motions, of the Sea and its ebbing and flowing, of the earth and the creatures thereon; when after all their ſearch, they were ſtill at a loſs; and for all the knowledge they attained, they proved but learned Dunces? what wouldſt thou then do for the knowledge of the God of nature, of the mighty poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth, of him to whom all things are leſs than nothing, of him, the knowledge of whom will make thee wiſe to Salvation.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64652:129"/> O Friend, this is the only knowledge worth ſeeking, worth getting, worth prizing, worth glorying in, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.23, 24. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, nor the rich man glory in his riches.</hi> Worldly knowledge, ſtrength, wealth, are not worth glorying in; what then is? The next verſe tells you, <hi>But let him that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, glory in this</hi> (in what?) <hi>that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. This is a jewel that a man may boaſt of, and glory in, <hi>that he knoweth me, that I am the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is an excellency in all knowledge. Knowledge is the eye of the Soul, to direct it in its motions; it is the lamp, the light of the Soul ſet up by God himſelf to guide it in its actions. The underſtanding of man is the candle of the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.27. Without knowledge the Soul is but a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of darkneſs, and blackneſs, full of confuſion and terror: But there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable excellency in the knowledge of this incomparable God. The object doth elevate and heighten the act. There is a vaſt difference between the knowledg of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and heavenly things; between the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64652:129"/> knowledge of wiſe, ſtrong, faithful, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, juſt, holy men, and the only wiſe, omnipotent, unchangeable, righteous, moſt holy God. Only before I proceed to the urging this Uſe, I would deſire thee Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take notice, what knowledge of God it is which I am preſſing thee to labour for; it is not a meer notional ſpeculative knowledge (though a knowledge of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion is a duty, &amp; neceſſary, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.9, 10. but an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental knowledge: <hi>Thou haſt made me to know wiſdom in my ſecret parts,</hi> Pſal. 51.6. (The heart is called the ſecret part, becauſe known only to God, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.39.) ſuch a knowledge as affecteth the heart (with love to him, and fear of him, and hatred of what is contrary to him; true knowledge takes the heart as well as takes the head, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.6. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.38. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10.) and influenceth the life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.4. <hi>He that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a lyar, and the truth is not in him.</hi> Coloſſ. 1.9, 10. <hi>John</hi> 10.4, 5. Right knowledge, though it begin at the head, doth not end there, but falls down upon the heart to affect that, and floweth out in the life to order and regulate that,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64652:130"/> 
                  <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.10. <hi>We pray for you, that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wiſdom, and ſpiritual underſtanding</hi> (for what end, and to what purpoſe) <hi>that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, being fruitful in every good work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To enforce this Uſe, I ſhall give thee two or three Motives, and as many means.</p>
               <p>To encourage thee to ſtudy the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this God, conſider theſe three properties of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The true knowledge of this God will be a ſanctifying knowledge. If thou haſt any thing of a <hi>man, I mean</hi> of Reaſon in thee, holineſs (which was thy primitive perfection, which is the Image of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable God, and will fit thee for his ſpecial love and eternal embraces) will be a ſtrong and cogent argument with thee. Now this knowledge of God will conform thee to God, render thee like unto him, who is the pattern and ſtandard of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. As I ſaid before, knowledge is the eye by which we ſee God, and the viſion of God cauſeth an aſſimulation to him. <hi>But we all with open face beholding as in a Glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, even
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64652:130"/> as by the Spirit of our God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. The Blackamore that often look'd on beautiful pictures, brought forth a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Son. We are often changed into the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures and faſhions, yea and diſpoſitions of thoſe whom we much converſe with on earth: ſurely then acquaintance with the gracious and Holy God, will make us in ſome meaſure to reſemble him.</p>
               <p>Other knowledge pollutes and defiles the ſoul: Oftentimes, the more men pick the lock of Natures Cabinet, and look into her riches, and treaſury, her ſecrets and myſteries; the more Atheiſtical they are, and forgetful of the God of Nature. Hence <hi>Religio Medici</hi> is irreligion; they ſee ſo much of the operations of nature, that they aſcribe the principal efficiency to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. And hence the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of the Philoſophers (counted the wiſeſt men in the world) <hi>is folly,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.19. And <hi>though they profeſſed themſelves to be wiſe, yet they became fools,</hi> and were guilty of all manner of wickedneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.22. to the end. And what was the reaſon, but this, <hi>they knew not God,</hi> with all their knowledge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. Ignorant heads are ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with irreligious hearts, and both
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64652:131"/> are attended with Atheiſtical lives, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. The Apoſtle tells us of the Heathen, that they were <hi>eſtranged from the life of God</hi> (an holy life) <hi>through the ignorance that was in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their hearts.</hi> So <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4. But the knowledg of God <hi>purifieth</hi> the ſoul. As the <hi>Sun</hi> conveyeth heat along with its light, ſo <hi>grace is multiplied through the knowledge of God,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.2. When <hi>Moſes</hi> had convers'd with God in the Mount, <hi>his feet ſhone,</hi> that the Jews could not behold him. When a Soul hath once acquainted himſelf with the bleſſed God, his life will ſhine with holineſs; therefore <hi>David</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth his Son <hi>Solomon, to know the God of his Fathers, and to ſerve him with a perfect heart, and willing mind;</hi> firſt, to know him; then to ſerve him, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9.</p>
               <p>This knowledge muſt needs be a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying knowledge, becauſe it renders ſin abominable, the world contemptible, God honourable, and the ſoul the more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of God will render <hi>ſin moſt abominable</hi> to the Soul, it renders ſin to be exceeding ſinful. The miſeries that befall us in our eſtates, names, bodies,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:64652:131"/> ſouls, nay, all the curſes of the Law, and torments of the damned, do not diſcover the ugly loathſome features, and monſtrous deformed nature of ſin, like the knowledge of this incomparable God. <hi>Job</hi> confeſſeth his ſin, <hi>Job</hi> 42.2. <hi>I uttered things that I underſtood not;</hi> nay, he <hi>abhorreth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> for his ſin, <hi>v.</hi> 5. But whence came he who ſometime juſtifyed himſelf too much, now to abhor himſelf? He gives us the reaſon or cauſe of it, <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear,</hi> (I had ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thee before) <hi>but now mine eyes ſee thee</hi> (I now have a clearer and fuller know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thee) <hi>wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> The more we know the greateſt good, the more we ſhall hate the greateſt evil.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of God will render <hi>the world contemptible</hi> to a Chriſtian. None undervalue the Creature, but thoſe who have had a ſight of the Creator; neither can any trample on the riches, honours, and pleaſures of this world, but thoſe who know him who is the riches, and honours, and pleaſures of the other world. They who never ſaw the <hi>Sun,</hi> wonder at a <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle:</hi> and they who never knew the bleſſed
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64652:132"/> God, wonder at, and are fond of poor low things, mean, ſmall, pitiful things on earth: But the whole world, with all its Crowns, and Scepters, and Diadems, and Delights, is but a dunghill to him that hath ſeen the incomparable God. <hi>Moſes</hi> could refuſe the honour of being the adopted Child of a Kings Heir, reject the pleaſures of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, and prefer the reproaches of Chriſt before all the Treaſures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when he had once got a ſight of the Incomparable God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25, 26, 27. <hi>For he ſaw him that was inviſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The knowledge of God will render <hi>God more honourable in our eſteems.</hi> The more we know of many things and perſons, the more we ſleight and deſpiſe them. The more we know ſin, the more we loath it; the more we know our ſelves, the more we abhor our ſelves; but the more we know God, the more we love him, and the more we admire him. The reaſon of all the contempt and affronts which we offer to God, is our ignorance of him. <hi>The whole world lyeth in wickedneſs,</hi> as a beaſt in its dung, or vermine in their ſlime, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. but the reaſon is what Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.25. <hi>Father the world hath not known
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64652:132"/> thee;</hi> for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>had they known, they would never have Crucified the Lord of Glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8. They who know God, cannot but ſee infinite reaſon why they ſhould love, and fear, and honour, and pleaſe him all their dayes. Why do you think is God ſo much wondred at, and worſhipped in his Church, more than in other parts of the world? Why doth he inhabit their higheſt praiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.3. and greateſt bleſſings and thankſgivings, but becauſe he is known more there than in other parts of the world. <hi>In Judah is God known</hi> (therefore) <hi>his name is great</hi> (his name alone is excellent) <hi>in Iſrael, Pſal.</hi> 76.1.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of God makes us <hi>humble.</hi> We never are ſo low in our own eyes, as when we ſee the moſt high God. The more we know of men that are more vain, and fooliſh, and wicked than our ſelves, the more we are exalted and puffed up; but the more we know of God, of the great God, the incomparable God, the moſt holy God, to whom we are as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, leſs than nothing, worſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; the more we abaſe our ſelves.</p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:64652:133"/>
               <p>When <hi>David</hi> is acquainted with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of God, <hi>O Lord, my Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth, and thy glory is above the Heavens!</hi> Pſal. 8.1. What low, little, diminutive thoughts, hath he of himſelf and others? <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>What is man? or, what is the Son of man?</hi> What a poor, pitiful, contemptible thing is man? What a vain, empty, inſignificant nothing is the Son of man? We are aſhamed of our ruſh Candles, or Glow-worms, &amp; hide our heads in the preſence of the Sun. The holieſt man abhors himſelf for his unholineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the moſt Holy God. So <hi>Job</hi> 25.2. <hi>Dominion and fear are with him,</hi> v. 3. <hi>There is no number of his Armies,</hi> v. 5. <hi>Behold even to the Moon, and it ſhineth not, and the Stars are not pure in his ſight: How much leſs man that is a worm, and the Son of man that is a worm?</hi> v. 6. A worm is the moſt deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contemptible creature, every beaſt trampleth on it; ſuch a creature is man in his own apprehenſions, when he once un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth the incomparable God.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had ſeen the Lord of Hoſts, though he were an Holy man, he cryeth out, <hi>I am undone, I am a man of unclean lips, for mine eyes have ſeen the Lord of Hoſts,</hi>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:64652:133"/> Iſa. 6.3, 4. He never ſaw ſo much of his own uncleanneſs, as when he ſaw him in whoſe preſence the Heavens are unclean. Other knowledge, like wind in a bladder, puffeth up, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. but the knowledge of God, as fire nigh the bladder, ſhrinks and ſhrivels it up to nothing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The knowledge of God is a <hi>ſatisfying knowledge.</hi> A man may know much of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and the more he knoweth, the more unquiet and reſtleſs he is; his knowledge, as <hi>wind</hi> to the ſtomack, may fill, and pain, and trouble him, but cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him: for, Creatures are not that ſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meat which the heaven-born ſpiritual immortal Soul of man would have, and muſt have, if ever it be contented. The greateſt Students, who have wearied and tired out their brains, and bodies, in the ſearch of Natures ſecrets, have found by experience, that they <hi>ſpent their ſtrength for what is not bread, and their labour for what will not ſatisfie;</hi> and they have known the truth of the Wiſe mans ſaying, He that increaſeth knowledge, increaſeth ſorrow, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.18.</p>
               <p>That knowledge which ſatisfieth, muſt be of an object that is ſuitable, in its ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64652:134"/> to the nature of the Soul; in its all-ſufficiency, to the manifold neceſſities of the Soul; and in its immortality, to the duration of the Soul; if either of theſe be wanting in it, the Soul cannot receive ſatisfaction by it, becauſe without all theſe the Soul cannot be perfectly happy; and till it find that which can make it perfectly happy, it will be reſtleſs. If it meet with an object that is ſuitable to its nature, yet if it be not anſwerable to all its wants, it will ſtill be complaining (wherein it is unſupplyed) and ſo unquiet? If it meet with an object that is ſuitable to its nature, and anſwerable to all its wants, yet if it be not eternal, it muſt needs be full of fears and troubles in the fore-thoughts of its amiſſion of ſo great a good, which would imbitter the preſent poſſeſſion of it; For the ſoul being incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and immortal it ſelf, cannot but deſire that good which will run parallel with its own life; and if it deſire it, nothing will fully ſatisfie it, till it obtain ſuch a good. Now nothing in this world is ſuitable to the Souls nature (the Soul is ſpiritual, the things of this world are carnal) nor anſwerable to the various indigencies of the Soul (the Souls wants are many, and in a manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64652:134"/> beſides, they are ſpiritual, as, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin, peace with God, peace of Conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when the good things of this life are particular, finite, and bodily) nor equal to the Souls duration (the Soul will abide and continue after millions of ages and generations, for ever and ever; but this world paſſeth away, and all the good things thereof.) But this God, whom I am perſwading thee, Reader, to know and acquaint thy ſelf with, is in all theſe reſpects perfect, and ſo will ſatisfie thy ſoul. God is a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> good, a Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.23. the Father of Spirits, and ſo ſuitable to the nature of thy ſoul. He is an <hi>univerſal</hi> good, all good, and ſo anſwerable to the many wants of thy Soul. He is an <hi>eternal</hi> good, a good that never dieth, never fadeth, a good that <hi>only hath immortality,</hi> and ſo is equal to thy ſouls duration; therefore the Diſciple cryeth out to Chriſt, <hi>ſhew us the Father, and it ſufficeth,</hi> Joh. 10.8. and <hi>David</hi> tells us, that he is fully pleaſed in having God for his portion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.5, 6.</p>
               <p>Give any man both that which he would have, and that which he <hi>ſhould</hi> have, and he is contented. If indeed you give a man what he would have, ſuppoſing it
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:64652:135"/> be that which he <hi>ſhould not</hi> have, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires being depraved and vitiated, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be contented when he hath what he deſired, becauſe luſts are unſatiable, and ſinful deſires never ſatisfied: (thence the Heathen Emperours had their Inventors of new pleaſures; and poſſibly that may be the meaning of that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. The Heathen wearied with common, inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, unnatural delights) But give a man what he would have, ſuppoſe it be what <hi>he ſhould have</hi> (his deſires being rectified) and he is then at eaſe and reſt.</p>
               <p>He who knoweth God aright, is fully ſatisfied in him; when he once drinketh of the <hi>Fountain of living waters,</hi> he thirſteth no more after other objects, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. Though the Soul ſtil deſireth to know more of God, till it come to that place where it ſhall <hi>know as it is known,</hi> as <hi>David,</hi> though ſatisfied with his portion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.4, 5. yet thirſted after more of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1, 2. yet it is quiet and contented in God. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the ſweetneſs which it taſteth in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the incomparable God, makes it long after nearer and fuller ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him. When <hi>Moſes</hi> was once acquainted with God, he begs that he
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:64652:135"/> might ſee and know more of his glory; and the reaſon is, becauſe while God is the object, there can be no ſatiety, he being the <hi>God of all joy and conſolation;</hi> neither can there be ſuch a full acquaintance as to ceaſe deſires after farther acquaintance, he being an object ſtill too great for the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to comprehend. The deſires of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified are without anxiety, becauſe they are ſatisfied in the object of their deſires; and their ſatisfaction or enjoyment is without ſatiety or loathing, becauſe they ſee ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite cauſe to deſire him.</p>
               <p>When the Soul once comes to know God (as the needle touch'd with the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, when it turns to the North) it is then quiet, though before, like the Dove, it hover'd up and down over the waters of this world, and could find no reſt. This knowledge, if right, diffuſeth into the Soul a ſweet tranquillity, ſilent peace, ſecret ſetled calmneſs, beſides a raviſhing prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, and bleſſed fore-fruition of its fuller acquaintance in the other life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The knowledge of God is a <hi>ſaving knowledge.</hi> Many periſh for all their great knowledge of Creatures; their knowledge may light them to the more diſmal Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64652:136"/> of death, of blackneſs of darkneſs for ever, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.24. And indeed their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (like many Pigs of Silver in a Veſſel ſinking) preſſeth them the deeper into Hell: but the knowledge of God is ſaving; God will know him in the other world, who knows him in this; He will be ſo far from knowing them hereafter who are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of him here, that he will come <hi>in flaming fire to render vengeance on them that know not God,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.7, 8. But he will own them, and take acquaintance with them then, that own him and are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him now, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.14. <hi>I will ſet him on high, becauſe he hath known my name.</hi> God will ſet him as high as Heaven, who knoweth his name on earth. Reader, it's as much worth as Heaven to thee to know this incomparable God. <hi>This is life eternal, to know thee the onely true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> Joh. 17.3. It is the <hi>morning,</hi> though not the Meridian of Heaven; it is the <hi>Bud,</hi> though not the ripe fruit of glory; it is the <hi>ſeed,</hi> though not the harveſt of the Inheritance above; to know the true God, and Jeſus Chriſt. This knowledge is of the <hi>ſame nature,</hi> though not of the ſame meaſure, with that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64652:136"/> in the other world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. Now the Chriſtian knoweth as a <hi>Child,</hi> then he ſhall know as a man; now he ſeeth God as it were at <hi>a diſtance</hi> through the proſpective glaſs of faith, but then he ſhall ſee God face to face; <hi>Now we ſee through a glaſs darkly, but then face to face; now we know in part, but then we ſhall know as we are known,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.12.</p>

               <p>THe means which I ſhall offer, as helpful to the attainment of his knowledge of God, are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Be ſenſible of thine ignorance of him.</hi> A conceited Scholar is no good learner. He that thinks he knoweth enough alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, will never be beholden to a Maſter to teach him more. <hi>Seeſt thou a man wife in his own conceit, there is more hope of a fool than of him,</hi> Prov. 26.12. This was that which lock'd up the Phariſees in the dark
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64652:137"/> dungeon of Ignorance: they were blind; Truth it ſelf called them blind, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.16, 17. But they conceited their eyes were good, and ſo neglected the means of curing them. <hi>Ye ſay ye ſee</hi> (I do not ſay ye ſee, but ye conceit ſo) <hi>therefore your ſin remaineth,</hi> Joh. 9.40, 41. therefore your ignorance continueth. When Ignorance and Confidence (which are often Twins) go together, the condition of a man is helpleſs; partly, becauſe ſuch a perſon will not take that pains in reading, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and conference, and meditation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the knowledge of God cannot be had, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be encreaſed.</hi> It's an alluſion to <hi>Merchants that</hi> run to this and that Port, to ſell out and take in commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; or to a <hi>Tradeſman,</hi> that runs to this and that Mart or place to buy and ſell, whereby their ſtocks are increaſed. But a conceited man will never labour thus for that which he thinks he hath already. <hi>If thou diggeſt as for ſilver, and ſearcheſt as for hid treaſure, then thou ſhalt underſtand the fear of the Lord, and attain the knowledg of God,</hi> Prov. 2.4, 5. Men count dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging hard work, and will ſweat at it when
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64652:137"/> they dig for ſilver: ſuch diligence muſt they uſe who will get the knowledge of God. But though poor men, who are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their want of the knowledge of God, and of their woful condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, will work to preſerve themſelves from periſhing; yet rich men, who think they can do well enough without it, will ſpare their pains, partly, becauſe all knowledge muſt be obtained from God by fervent prayer; and a conceited man will neither be inſtant with God for it, nor will God give it to him. God is the <hi>God of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.2. And from him all true ſaving knowledg cometh, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.6. <hi>The Lord giveth wiſdom, out of his mouth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth knowledge and underſtanding.</hi> As none can ſee the Sun (by candle light) but by its own light; ſo none can know God ſavingly (by the light of nature) but by light derived from himſelf. Now a conceited perſon will not go to God for knowledge: What need I (thinks he) I have enough already. Poverty is a friend to prayer, <hi>the poor uſeth intreaties,</hi> Prov. 18.23. But pride or conceitedneſs is an enemy to prayer, <hi>The wicked through the Pride of his countenance will not ſeek after
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:64652:138"/> God,</hi> Pſal. 10.4. Who will beg that of his neighbour, which he is confident he hath at home? Neither will God undertake the inſtruction of proud Scholars: <hi>The humble he will teach, the meek he will guide in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Pſal. 25.9. Such as are willing to be taught, will be thankful for their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and are fitted for guidance and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; but conceited perſons are quite contrary. Therefore Reader beware of this miſt in which many miſcarry. <hi>He that thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth he knoweth any thing, knoweth nothing as he ought to know,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.2. But la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to get thine heart affected with thine ignorance, and the woful conſequents of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.10, 11. This will be a good ſtep to knowledg. The Apoſtle gives thee the ſame direction, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>If any man ſeem to be wiſe, let him become a fool that he may be wiſe.</hi> If thou ſeemeſt to be knowing, be ignorant (in thy own ſenſe and feeling and apprehenſion) that thou mayſt be knowing. Our Lord Jeſus gives the ſame counſel to the ſick and dying <hi>Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceans,</hi> Rev. 3.17, 18. and acquaints her that her ignorance of her ignorance, and conceitedneſs of her knowledge, was the great hinderance of her recovery.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:64652:138"/>2. <hi>Study much the works, and eſpecially the word of God.</hi> The works of God are a Book wherein you may read of him, and by which you may hear of him. <hi>The heavens declare his glory,</hi> Pſal. 19.1. <hi>The earth is full of his goodneſs,</hi> Pſal. 33.5. As the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow hath ſome proportion to the body to which it relates, ſo the works of God are ſome repreſentation of the wiſe powerful gracious God, to whom they belong, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 21. <hi>The inviſible things of God are ſeen by the things that are made, even his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal power and Godhead.</hi> Therefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the works of the Lord, and the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his hands.</p>
               <p>The word of God is a <hi>glaſs,</hi> wherein thou mayeſt ſee his beauty and grace and glory, and ſo ſee him as to be transformed into his likeneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. In the works of God you may ſee his ſteps, the prints of his feet, they are therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his <hi>paths</hi> and <hi>his goings,</hi> Pſal. 77.19. But in his word we may ſee his <hi>face,</hi> the comlineſs of his countenance, how lovely and amiable he is; therefore it is called a <hi>glaſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. So that as the ſight of a mans face helpeth and conduceth more to our knowledge of him, than the ſight of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64652:139"/> his ſteps; ſo the word of God is a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter means of our acquaintance with him, than the Works of Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Therefore I ſay, ſtudy eſpecially the word of God. The Scripture is the <hi>key of knowledg,</hi> Luk. 11.52. and unlocks the myſteries which were kept hid from Ages and Generations, and opens the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of heaven to thy ſoul. It's therefore called <hi>light, Pſal.</hi> 119.105. and a <hi>Lamp, Prov.</hi> 6.23. Becauſe it diſcovers hidden things, helps thee to ſee what thou canſt not without it, and directs thee in thy motions and actions. <hi>David</hi> had more knowledge than his <hi>enemies,</hi> (and they were ſubtil) than his <hi>Teachers</hi> (and they were no dwarfes in knowledge, ſuch as <hi>Gad</hi> and <hi>Nathan</hi>) than the <hi>Ancient</hi> (and with <hi>the ancient is wiſdom, and in length of days is underſtanding,</hi> Job 12.12, 13.) and what was the means of it, <hi>For thy teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are my meditation,</hi> Pſal. 119.97, 98, 99.

The fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancy and attractiveneſs of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable God, increaſeth up and down in the world as the Goſpel is propagated. <hi>Thanks be to God who maketh manifest the

Therefore, whoever thou art that ſitteſt in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, go to the Sun for light, go to the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs, in whom are all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge,</hi> Col. 2.9. for the light of the knowledge of God.

Again, obſerve how kindly he took it of <hi>Solomon,</hi> (when he bid <hi>Solomon</hi> ask what he would) that he asked wiſdom, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Give me wiſdom and knowledge, ſaith</hi> Solomon: <hi>And the thing which</hi> Solomon <hi>asked pleaſed the Lord,</hi> 1 Kings 3.10.

It's an ineffable priviledge that thou art a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture capable of ſo vaſt an happineſs, it's a ſpecial favour that thou haſt leave to aſpire after ſuch an immenſe inheritance; and when its tender'd to thee, wilt thou refuſe it? wilt thou neglect it?

               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:64652:142"/>
               <p>Having ſpoken in another Treatiſe to this particular, I ſhall here only offer two or three things to thy ſerious thoughts, and proceed to a third exhortation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, <hi>what is offer'd thee,</hi> when the incomparable God is offered thee for thy portion. And truly, to explain this head fully, would require the Pen, yea, exceed the skil of an Angel. None can tell what God is, but God himſelf. All the ſheets in the explication of the Doctrine ſpeak ſomwhat of him, but not the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſandth part of that excellency that is in him. Reader, I may tell thee, when God is offered thee, the greateſt good that ever was, that ever will be, that ever can be, is offered thee; there never was, or can be, the like offer'd thee; more than Heaven and Earth, than both Worlds, than Millions of Worlds, is offered thee. This God who is offered thee, is the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, the God of Gods, the bleſſed and glorious Potentate, the firſt Cauſe, the original Being, Self-ſufficient, All-ſufficient, abſolutely perfect, uncapable of any addition or diminution. This God who is offer'd thee, is the high and lofty one, that inhabiteth eternity eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment, to whom a thouſand years,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:64652:143"/> yea millions of Ages are but as one day, as one moment, whoſe duration is uncapable of the leaſt acceſſion, who is boundleſs in his being, omnipotent in his power, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable in his wiſdom, unconceivable in his grace, and infinite in all his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. He dwelleth in that light that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible; before him Angels, the higheſt of creatures, vail their faces; to him the whole Creation is leſs than nothing and vanity. This God who is offered thee made all things of nothing, ſupports all things, influenceth all things, and is all things, and infinitely more than all things. He is ſo needful a good, that thou art undone without him. This was the miſery of the Heathen on earth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. and of the damned in Hell, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.41. the very Hell of Hell. He is ſo plentiful a good that thou art perfectly happy in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. <hi>ult.</hi> thou needeſt no more. He is the Heaven of Heavens, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>ult.</hi> the ſafeſt refuge. O Friend, what doſt thou think of having this God for thy portion? Is it not worth the while to have this God for thy God? wilt thou not ſay, <hi>Foraſmuch as there is none like unto thee, O Lord; thou art great, and thy name is great: Who would
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64652:143"/> not fear thee, O King of Nations?</hi> Jer. 10.6, 7. Again, the God who is offered thee, is the Well of Salvation, the Lord of life, the God of all conſolation, an Hive of ſweetneſs, a Paradice of pleaſure, an Heaven of joy. He is the richeſt grace, the deareſt love, the ſureſt friend, the higheſt honour, the vaſteſt treaſure, the exacteſt beauty, the chiefeſt good, and the fulleſt felicity. He is one that can enlarge and ſute all thy faculties, relieve and anſwer all thy neceſſities, fill up and ſatisfie all the capacities of thine Heaven-born ſoul. God is a good which Chriſt died to purchaſe for thee, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. And ſurely if Chriſt thought him worth his blood, he is worthy thine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. God is a comprehenſive uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal good, not one, but all good, Riches, Honours, Pleaſures, Friends, Relations, Health, Life, Earth, Heaven, this World, the other World, all the good of both Worlds, and infinitely more; and art thou not covetous of ſuch wealth that is better worth than both worlds? <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.1. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. God is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting good, a good that will ſtand by thee, and abide with thee when all other good things ſhall fail thee, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:64652:144"/> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. He is that good which thou wouldſt have if thou art well in thy wits: he is that good which thou ſhouldſt have if thou anſwereſt the end of thy Creation; he is that good which thou muſt have, if thou art not eternally miſerable; He is the only ſuitable ſatisfying good, which hits the nature, and fits the deſire of the rational creature. O Reader, I ſay again, what doſt thou think of having this incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable God for thy God? Surely by this time thy heart may well melt into aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he will allow thee to ſeek ſo matchleſs a portion. Well, what ſayeſt thou to him? Is it not worth the while to have him for thine, to whom thou wilt call in the day of diſtreſs, to whom thou wilt cry in a dying hour, when thy Soul ſtands quivering on thy lips, ready to take its flight into the unknown Regions of the other world, when Devils will be waiting to ſeize it, as ſoon as ever it leaves the body, to hale it to the unquenchable flames of hell, when thy Friends and Relations ſhall be weeping and wailing by thee, but unable to afford thy dying body the leaſt Cordial, or thy departing ſoul the leaſt Comfort. Ah friend, what wilt thou do in ſuch an
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:64652:144"/> hour, which is haſtening on thee, without the incomparable God? Believe it, though thou mayeſt live without him, thou canſt not dye (without an infinite horror) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. Is it not worth the while to have him for thine, to whom thou muſt ſtand or fall for ever, from whoſe mouth thy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of eternal abſolution or condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt come, and who ſhall judge thee to thine unchangeable ſtate of life or death? though thou mayeſt think thou canſt do well enough at this day with the world for thy portion; yet what wilt thou do at that day, when the world ſhall be in a flame, if God be not thy portion? Art thou willing or not, to have this God for thine? What ſayeſt thou? Canſt thou find in thine heart to deprive thy precious ſoul of ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable treaſure, and to leave it naked in the other world to the cruelty of Devils, and the dreadful curſes of the Law? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, though I have ſpoken little, yet I have ſaid enough (to one that will but let his reaſon judge) to draw out thy moſt earneſt deſires after this incomparable God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider <hi>upon what terms</hi> thou mayſt have this God for thy God. You may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:64652:145"/> think that ſo boundleſs a good muſt coſt you very dear, and the price muſt be vaſt of a pearl that is ſo matchleſs: but lo, to thy comfort, all the condition which God requireth of thee, is only to accept him heartily and thankfully in his Son. Canſt thou have any thing cheaper? wouldſt thou deſire him in his terms to fall lower? nay is it poſſible ſo to do, and make thee happy? Nor can he be thine unleſs thou receiveſt him for thine. It's a poor favour that is not worth acceptance. Do but take him for your happineſs, and you ſhall have him for your happineſs.</p>
               <p>Thou giveſt more for thy bread, thy cloaths, thy houſe, for the needful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts that are for the ſupport of thy frail body, than thou needeſt give for the great glorious incomprehenſible incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable God. Thou payeſt money for them, but thou mayſt have him without money and without price. One would think that the equity of the condition ſhould both amaze thee and allure thee. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I ſay, God doth not require of thee things <hi>impoſſible</hi> to thee; he doth not ſay, if thou wilt remove Mountains, dry up Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſtop the courſe of Nature, create
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:64652:145"/> worlds, I will then be thine, as great as I am; He doth not ſay, if thou wilt ſatisfie my juſtice, anſwer the demands of my law, merit my love and favour, then I will be thy God; No, he himſelf hath done all this for thee by the death of his Son: All he deſireth is, that thou wouldſt accept him in his Son for thy God. Nay, he doth not require of thee any thing that is <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous or cruel,</hi> as the heathen Deities did (by the Devil) of their worſhipers. He doth not ſay, if you will lance and mangle your bodies, as <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts did; if ye will go bare-foot in Sackcloth long and tedious pilgrimages, as the Papiſts do; if ye will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your children in the fire, and give the fruit of your bodies for the ſins of your ſouls, as ſome did, then I will be your God. Again, he doth not require of thee things that are <hi>chargeable,</hi> to offer the beſt and chief of thy flock daily in ſacrifice to him; nor as he once did of the young man, <hi>to ſell all</hi> that thou haſt, and give it to the poor; nor as Idolaters, to lay down ſuch a part of thy eſtate for thy pardon: but he only requires that thou wouldeſt take the Lord for thy God; and wilt thou not do it? Canſt thou deny him and thy poor ſoul ſo
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:64652:146"/> reaſonable, ſo equitable a requeſt? As the ſervant ſaid to Naaman, <hi>If the Prophet had commanded thee ſome great thing, wouldeſt not thou have done it? how much more then when he only ſaith, waſh, and be clean?</hi> So ſay I to thee; If God had commanded the greateſt things imaginable, wouldeſt thou not to thy power have done them, that thou mightſt enjoy the bleſſed God for thy eternal portion? how much more then when he only ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other God before me?</hi> O Reader, do but obſerve that firſt Command, which contains the ſum both of thy duty and felicity, and thou art made, thou art a bleſſed man for ever. Take the true God in Jeſus Chriſt for thy God, prize him as thy God, love him as thy God, Honour him as thy God, and obey him as thy God, and he will be thy God for ever. Do but as much for the true God, as the covetous man doth for his wealth, which is his God; as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate man for his belly, which is his God; they give their higheſt eſteem, their choiceſt affections, and their greateſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to that which they take for their God. And ſurely, the true God is more worthy hereof, and will requite thee beſt for them.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:64652:146"/>3. Conſider, <hi>For what end</hi> God offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelf to thee. I would not have thee miſtake, becauſe God out of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite pity to his miſerable creatures, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and urgent with them to accept of him, to think therefore that God hath any need of thee, or ſeeketh his own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs therein; I tell thee, if thou hadſt no more need of God than he hath of thee, thou mayſt let him alone: No, it's purely for thy good, for thy real and eternal good that he offereth himſelf to thee: he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thy ſervice no more than he doth the ſervice of the damned, of the devils, and he knoweth how to make uſe of thee for his own glory, as he doth of them, if thou fooliſhly rejecteſt his offer of himſelf. <hi>Thy righteouſneſs will not help him,</hi> Job 22.2, 3. nor <hi>thy wickedneſs hurt him,</hi> Job 35.2. He offereth himſelf to thee, not that he may be <hi>bleſsed</hi> by thee, but that he may be <hi>bountiful</hi> to thee. It's thy good, not his own, that he looks at; the felicity of accepting him is thine own, and the miſery of neglecting him is thine own, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.12. Men call cuſtomers to them, preſs them with many arguments and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties to buy, that they may inrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:64652:147"/> by their cuſtomers; but God calls men to buy of him, not to inrich himſelf, (He is as rich and perfect and happy as he can be) but to inrich themſelves, <hi>I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel thee</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to his luke-warm Church) <hi>to buy of me gold,</hi> (why, that he may get ſomewhat by her, and enrich himſelf? No) <hi>that thou mayst be rich;</hi> that thou (not I) mayſt be rich. Now Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ponder it ſeriouſly, it is wholly for thy own good, that thou mayſt eſcape wrath and death, and attain heaven and life, that God is pleaſed once more to offer himſelf to thee. What is thy mind about his offer? Wilt thou have him for thy portion, or no? Is there any thing unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in his deſire or demands? Doth not thy eternal felicity depend on thine accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of him? What ſayſt thou? Wilt thou have God for thy portion, or wilt thou have the Devil for thy portion? Thou ſhalt have an eternal portion, good or bad. The worldlings portion of good things is but for this world, and the godly mans portion of evil things is but for this world: Both have immortal ſouls, which will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the other world for ever; and their ſouls muſt have immortal portions to abide
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:64652:147"/> with them there for ever. Therefore, Reader, conſider what thou doeſt, either thou muſt take God in and through Chriſt for thy portion for ever, or hell and death and wrath and Devils for thy portion for ever: One of the two is the portion of all the ſons and daughters of <hi>Adam.</hi> If thou wilt ſtill prefer the world before God and love the creature above God, and pleaſe thy fleſh more than God; when once thou appeareſt in the other world, God will rain on thee <hi>fire and brimſtone, and an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible tempeſt, this will be the portion of thy cup,</hi> Pſal. 11.6. But if now thou accepteſt him in his Son (for there is no making God thy friend, but by Chriſt) for thy chiefeſt good and happineſs, when all thy friends ſhall leave thee, and deareſt relations for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee, yea when <hi>thy fleſh and thy heart ſhall fail thee, God will be the ſtrength of thine heart, and thy portion for ever.</hi> O friend, conſider what I have ſaid in this Uſe, and the Lord give thee underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that thou mayſt know when thou art well offered, and be wiſe on this ſide the other world.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVI. 3. Ex.</hi> Give God the glory of his incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable excellency: with ſome conſiderations to enforce it.</head>
               <p>IF God be ſuch an incomparable God, <hi>give him the glory and honour</hi> of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable excellencies: His incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perfections muſt have incomparable praiſes. <hi>Praiſe him,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his excellent greatneſs,</hi> Pſal. 159.2. But alas! what tongue, what underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of men or Angels can do it, can praiſe him according to his excellent greatneſs? But though we cannot praiſe him according to the utmoſt of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, we muſt praiſe him according to the utmoſt of our abilities. The higheſt God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.1. muſt have the higheſt praiſes. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.8. <hi>The high praiſes of God are in their mouths.</hi> The greateſt God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.3. muſt have our greateſt praiſes. <hi>Great is the Lord and greatly to be praiſed.</hi> Low or little praiſes are a diſpraiſe to one ſo eminently, ſo infinitely high and great.</p>
               <p>Ordinary commendations of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:64652:148"/> perſon are a diſcommendation to him. <hi>According to thy name, ſo, O Lord, is thy praiſe to the end of the earth,</hi> Pſal. 48.10. Therefore his name <hi>alone being excellent,</hi> Pſal. 148.13. his praiſe alone muſt be excellent. <hi>David</hi> tells God, <hi>I will praiſe thee yet more and more,</hi> Pſal. 71.14. He had already praiſed him much, but he would endeavour to praiſe him more; and when he had done ſo, he would praiſe him more, and ſtill more. We read of ſongs of degrees, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120, 121. We ſhould aſcend in our praiſes of God by an holy climax, till we come to the higheſt degree that is poſſible, and ſcrew up our faculties herein to the utmoſt pitch that they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of.</p>
               <p>Praiſe him for the incomparableneſs of his <hi>being.</hi> That he is an independent, all-ſufficient, abſolutely perfect, incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, omnipreſent, eternal, infinite being, ſhould much affect our hearts. <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord, Praiſe him, O ye ſervants of the Lord, Praiſe the name of the Lord; Bleſſed from this time forth, and for ever: From the riſing of the Sun, to the going down of the ſame, the Lords name is to be praiſed:</hi> (why) <hi>the Lord is high above all Nations, and his glory
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:64652:149"/> above the Heavens; who is like to the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high?</hi> Pſal. 113.1, to 6.</p>
               <p>Praiſe him for his incomparableneſs in his <hi>attributes,</hi> for the incomparableneſs of his power. <hi>O Lord God of Hoſt, who is a ſtrong Lord like unto thee?</hi> Pſal. 89.8. For the incomparableneſs of his holineſs, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, glorious in holineſs?</hi> Exod. 15.11. For the incomparableneſs of his mercy, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning iniquity, and paſſing by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of the remnant of his heritage, becauſe he delighteth in mercy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Praiſe him for the incomparableneſs of his <hi>Words; O that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and for his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works to the children of men,</hi> Pſal. 107.8.15, 21, 31. Pſal. 72.18. Pſal. 136.4. Praiſe him for the work of Creation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 114.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Job</hi> 38.4, 5, 6. Praiſe him for his works of Providence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.8, 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136. throughout, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. Praiſe him eſpecially for the work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, who hath viſited and redeemed his people.</hi> Luk. 1.68. Pſal. 9.1. Rev. 15.3.</p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:64652:149"/>
               <p>Praiſe him for the incomparableneſs of his <hi>Word, Wonderful are thy Teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 119.129. How often doth the ſweet Singer of <hi>Iſrael</hi> praiſe God for them, as a ſingular kindneſs? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. two laſt verſes, <hi>He gave his Statutes to</hi> Moſes, <hi>his Laws and Commandments to</hi> Jacob: <hi>He hath not dealt ſo with every Nation. Praiſe ye the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Praiſe him by <hi>admiring him.</hi> Wonder at his <hi>being,</hi> As they of Chriſt, <hi>What manner of man is this, that the winds and ſeas obey him?</hi> Math. 8.27. <hi>What manner of God is this, who knoweth no bounds, no beginning, no ſucceſſion, no addition?</hi> An amazing admiration of him, is an high commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him. And indeed our ſilent won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at his perfections, is almoſt all the worſhip we can give him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.1. <hi>Praiſe waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion,</hi> Heb. <hi>Praiſe is ſilent for thee, O God, in Sion:</hi> not that praiſe was dumb or tongue-tyed in <hi>Sion;</hi> for praiſe in no part of the world ſpeaks higher or louder than in <hi>Sion:</hi> but to ſhew that when the people of God ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to praiſe him, they are ſtruck with amazement and wonder, at his matchleſs being and beauty, at his infinite excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and perfections; and wanting words
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:64652:150"/> to expreſs them, they ſit down in a ſilent admiration of them. Thou wouldſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at <hi>Adam,</hi> if he were now alive, for his age; O wonder at him that is from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to everlaſting, that is the cauſe and original of all things, that is what he is, that is, and nothing elſe is; that is all he is in one indiviſible point of eternity.</p>
               <p>Wonder at his <hi>attributes,</hi> admire his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. <hi>Behold he putteth no truſt in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he chargeth the Angels with folly,</hi> Job 4.18. Behold, wonder at it. Again, <hi>Behold he putteth no truſt in his Saints, the Heavens are not clean in his ſight,</hi> Job 15.15. Admire his wiſdom, cry out with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>O the depth of the wiſdom and knowledg of God,</hi> Rom. 11.33. Admire his love, <hi>Behold what manner of love hath the Father loved us with,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.1. Admire his power, that he can do what he will do: <hi>Who is a ſtrong Lord like unto thee?</hi> Pſal. 89.8.</p>
               <p>Wonder at his <hi>Works.</hi> Thou art ready to wonder at the rare works of ſome curious Artiſt; alaſs, all their works are toyes to the works of the mighty Creator and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of Heaven and Earth. <hi>O Lord, how marvellous are thy works!</hi> Pſal. 104.24. <hi>His work is honourable and glorious,</hi>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:64652:150"/> Pſal. 111.3. and worthy thy greateſt wonder.</p>
               <p>What a piece is the Creation! how marveilous! how myſterious! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>The Heavens declare his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> Pſal. 19.1. and the earth is <hi>full of his goodneſs,</hi> Pſal. 104.24. What a work is Providence? read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. and 107. How many rarities, curioſities, myſteries, are wrapt up in it, which are only ſeen in the other world? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.19.</p>
               <p>What man is this, ſay they, for he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth with authority, and the unclean Spirits come out of men? <hi>Mark</hi> 1.27.</p>
               <p>What a Maſter-piece, what rare work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip indeed is Redemption? a work that the Angels are alwayes prying into, and wondering at, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.</p>
               <p>Wonder at his Word. When thou heareſt it, doſt thou not perceive a Majeſty and Authority awing thy Conſcience accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying it? <hi>And they were all amazed and aſtoniſhed at his Doctrine,</hi> Luk. 4.32. The very Officers who were ſent to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Chriſt, could not but wonder at his words, and returned to them who ſet them a work, <hi>Never man ſpake as he ſpake,</hi> Joh. 7.47. There are <hi>great things</hi> in the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:64652:151"/> Law of God, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 8.12. things that are <hi>wonderful,</hi> Pſal. 119.18. which may well be wondered at; And all, ſaith the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, bare him witneſs, and <hi>wondred at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth,</hi> Luk. 4.22.</p>
               <p>Praiſe him by ſpeaking alwayes highly and honourably of him. If his name alone be excellent, take heed that thou doſt not take his excellent name <hi>in vain.</hi> Thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of him muſt be ever high, and thy expreſſions of him honourable. Thy Tongue is therefore call'd thy glory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe therewith thou mayeſt glorifie thy God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.8.</p>
               <p>Never ſpeak of God raſhly, or at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, without a ſerious conſideration of whom thou ſpeakeſt; and let thy expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of him, and to him, be becoming his vaſt perfections, <hi>Aſcribe greatneſs to our God,</hi> Deut. 32.3.</p>
               <p>Speak honourably of his being, So <hi>Moſes</hi> Exod. 15.11. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, glorious in holineſs, fearful in praiſes?</hi> So <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Kings 8.23. <hi>Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>there is no God like unto thee in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath.</hi> So <hi>David,</hi> 1 Chron. 29.11.</p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:64652:151"/>
               <p>Speak honourably of his attributes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.34. of his power, mercy, truth, juſtice, wiſdom, and holineſs, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hoſts,</hi> Iſa. 6.3.</p>
               <p>Speak honourably of his words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.8. <hi>Among all the Gods, there is none like unto thee; neither are there any works like unto thy works,</hi> Pſal. 145.10.</p>
               <p>Speak honourably of his Word. The Commandments of the Lord are pure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. Thy word is very pure: The Statutes of the Lord are right, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.10. <hi>The Law is holy, juſt, and good,</hi> Rom. 7.12. Though <hi>Paul</hi>'s corruption took occaſion by the Laws prohibitions, to become the more unruly (as the water at a Bridge roars the more for the ſtop) yet he dares not lay the leaſt fault upon the Law, but layeth all upon himſelf: <hi>was the Law Sin? God forbid,</hi> v. 7. Far be it from me to have the leaſt ſuch thought: No, the Law is holy, but I am carnal, ſold under ſin, <hi>v.</hi> 14. So when he ſpeaketh of the Goſpel, how honourably doth he ſpeak of it? ſomtimes he calls it the <hi>glorious Goſpel,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4. the <hi>myſteries of the Goſpel,</hi> Eph. 6.19. the <hi>word of Truth,</hi> 1 Coloſſ. 5.</p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:64652:152"/>
               <p>Praiſe him by <hi>walking circumſpectly and cloſely with him.</hi> Live alwayes as one that believeth, he hath at all times to do with this incomparable God; and is created and preſerved, and redeemed, to ſhew forth the praiſe of this God. When the Pſalmiſt had admired the incomparableneſs of this God in his being and doings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.8. he preſently ſubjoyns, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>All Nations whom thou haſt made, ſhall come and glorifie thy name, and worſhip before thee: For thou art great, and doſt wondrous things, thou art God alone.</hi> O Friend, this incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable God, muſt have incomparable obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>Be ſtill, and know that I am God,</hi> Pſal. 46.10. <hi>Be ſtill,</hi> be quiet, O ſinner, ceaſe, forbear any farther to offend me, and <hi>know that I am God,</hi> incomparable in knowledge, acquainted with all thy wayes and works, inward, outward, ſecret, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, publick; incomparable in holineſs, and perfectly hate all thy wickedneſs; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable in power, able to revenge my ſelf on thee every moment, to turn thee body and ſoul into hell; incomparable in juſtice, and will by <hi>no means clear the guilty;</hi> yet incomparable in mercy, and will accept and receive Prodigals, that,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:64652:152"/> ſenſible of their folly and filthineſs, return home to me their Father, in the Son of my love. <hi>Be ſtill,</hi> ſinner, <hi>Know</hi> this, <hi>that I am God,</hi> and obey my Laws. But I have ſpoken more fully of this in the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; only remember, that the praiſe of thy life, is the life of thy praiſe; becauſe hereby thou doſt in ſome meaſure repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the excellencies of this incomparable God viſible to the world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Math.</hi> 5.18. Offering praiſe, and ordering the converſation aright, are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by God himſelf, and let not us part them aſunder, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. laſt verſe but one.</p>
               <p>To help thee a little, that thou mayſt give God the praiſe of his incomparable perfections, Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This God is <hi>excellency it ſelf:</hi> he is not only <hi>excellent,</hi> Pſal. 8.1. and <hi>alone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,</hi> Pſal. 148.13. but <hi>excellency,</hi> Job. 13.11. <hi>Should not his excellency make thee affraid?</hi> nay, he is <hi>greatneſs of excellency,</hi> Exod. 15.7. nothing but excellency, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.6. Now think with thy ſelf what honour is due to one that is excellent, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone excellent, excellency it ſelf, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but excellency. Can thy higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be high enough, or thy moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:64652:153"/> praiſes be excellent enough, for ſuch an excellency.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This God is the <hi>ſtandard</hi> of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. Nothing is excellent but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its relation or likeneſs to him. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is more or leſs excellent as it is more or leſs related or conformable to him. Saints are <hi>the excellent of the earth,</hi> Pſal. 16.3. <hi>more excellent than their neighbours,</hi> Prov. 12.26. but it is becauſe of his affection to them. <hi>Since thou art precious in my ſight thou art honourable,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Jacob whom he loved.</note> Iſa. 43.4. and becauſe of their relation and likeneſs to him, Deut. 33.29. 1 Pet. 2.9. Pſal. 48.2, 3. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the moſt excellent of books, none like them. <hi>I have written unto thee excellent things,</hi> Prov. 22.20. But what's the reaſon? Surely becauſe they are the <hi>word of God,</hi> Eph. 3.16. <hi>his mind,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. ult. <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God.</hi> 2 Tim. 3.18. The Sabbath is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of days, the queen of days, the golden ſpot of the week, becauſe it is his day, ſet apart by him, and devoted to him: <hi>My holy day, the holy of the Lord, honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> Iſa. 58.13. Grace is excellent, the beauty and glory of the creature, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. more excellent than gold
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:64652:153"/> or fine gold, than rubies or pearls, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.14, 15. but why? becauſe it's his Image, it's a conformity to his nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. When the Holy Ghoſt would render any thing excellent, he mentions it with relation to God: <hi>The Cedars of God, the City of God, the Trees of God, the Mountains of God,</hi> &amp;c. that is, the moſt excellent Cedars, Cities, Trees, and Mountains.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is ſo excellent, that even <hi>Angels vail their faces</hi> in his preſence. The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Cherubims &amp; Seraphims, who are ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in their natures, and faultleſs in their lives, who are the higheſt and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt, and ancienteſt Houſe of the Creation, who, as his ſpecial friends and favourites are allowed to wait on him continually, to behold him face to face, and to enjoy him fully and perfectly; yet theſe Angels vail their faces before him (as it were) aſhamed of their Star-light in the Preſence of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and their drops in the preſence of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> Iſa. 6.1, 2, 3. <hi>I ſaw the Lord ſitting on a Throne high and lifted up; about it ſtood the Seraphims, each had ſix wings, with twain he did fly, with twain he cover'd his feet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with twain he cover'd his face.</hi> To
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:64652:154"/> cover the face is a ſign or fruit of baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as in <hi>Rebekah,</hi> Gen. 24.65. The face of an Angel is void of all ſpots and wrinkles, it is full of beauty and brightneſs, a moſt excellent face. <hi>And all the Councel looking ſtedfaſtly on him, beheld his face as if it had been the face of an Angel,</hi> Acts 6. <hi>ult.</hi> yet this face, as excellent as it is, they cover (as it were) aſhamed of it before that God who alone is excellent.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He is ſo incomparably excellent, that <hi>he humbleth himſelf to take notice of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Spirits, his heavenly hoſt,</hi> and their <hi>perfect Service</hi> in Heaven. It is not only great and infinite condeſcention with him to obſerve the higheſt perſons on earth, as Kings, and Princes; and the holieſt perſons on earth, as the moſt eminent Saints, and the higheſt and holieſt performances of theſe Saints; but it is boundleſs humiliation in him to look upon (with the leaſt reſpect) the perfect Spirits of juſt men, the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Powers that are in Heaven, and their pure perfect Worſhip and Service, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.5, 6. <hi>Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high, who hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth himſelf to behold the things that are in Heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:64652:154"/>5. He is ſo incomparably excellent, that he is <hi>above the higheſt adoration and worſhip of his Creatures. Worſhip</hi> is the moſt high and honourable of all our works. <hi>Bleſſing and Praiſing</hi> God is the moſt high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable act of worſhip; therefore this is that part of worſhip which ſuits the higheſt and honourableſt ſtate of the Creature in Heaven, and muſt continue for ever. As all our graces, of faith, and hope, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall e're long be melted into love, and joy, and delight; ſo all our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Confeſſion, Petition, Hearing and Reading the Word, receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhall all be melted into Praiſe and Thankſgiving, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.11, 12. <hi>And the Angels and Elders that ſtood about the throne fell on their faces before the throne, and worſhipped, ſaying,</hi> Amen, <hi>Bleſſing, and honour, and thanksgiving, be unto our God for ever;</hi> and therefore <hi>David</hi> calls upon Angels, and the Heavenly Hoſt, to praiſe God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.2, 3. But this incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably excellent God is above all this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, this higheſt worſhip; though he be not above it, ſo as to <hi>deſpiſe</hi> it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. and <hi>ult.</hi> yet he is above it, ſo as to <hi>exceed</hi> it; that his Saints and Angels, though their
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:64652:155"/> powers are enlarged to the uttermoſt, though the ſtrings of their faculties are wound and ſcrewed up to the higheſt pitch and peg, to ſound forth his praiſe, even then they will fall infinitely ſhort of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and bleſſing him, according to his deſerts, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Bleſſed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all bleſſing and praiſe.</hi> He doth not ſay, the name of God is exalted above the bleſſing and praiſe of men, of Saints on earth, in their imperfect ſtate; nor above the bleſſing and praiſe of Spirits of juſt men, in heaven made perfect; but above all bleſſing and praiſe, above the bleſſing and praiſe of Men, of Angels, of the holieſt Men, of the higheſt Angels, <hi>above all bleſſing and praiſe</hi> whatſoever, and of whomſoever.</p>

He is ſo incomparably excellent, that his excellencies are beyond the <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and apprehenſion of Men and Angels.</hi> The excellency of God is not only beyond all our expreſſions, verbal in our words, vital or real in our lives; but alſo beyond all our apprehenſions. A fluent tongue may ſpeak much of the excellency of God; an enlarged rational underſtanding can apprehend much more, (The mind of man
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:64652:155"/> is much wider than his mouth) but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of God is infinitely beyond all our apprehenſions of him; His works are unſearchable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. <hi>Lo, he goeth by me, and I ſee him not; he paſſeth on, and I perceive him not,</hi> Job 9.11. He goeth by me in his works, he paſſeth by me in the operations of his hands, and I perceive him not. There are ſuch motions of God in the heavenly bodies, earthly plants, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary providences, the growth of a Child in the womb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that men are nonpluſt at them, they are at a loſs about the nature, reaſon, and mode, or gradual progreſſions of them. How much more is his <hi>being</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable, and his <hi>eſſence</hi> paſt finding out? If his <hi>footſteps</hi> are unconceivable and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, much more is his <hi>face;</hi> if his works cannot be apprehended, much leſs can his nature; becauſe his works are in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect finite, as they are terminated on li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited beings, and they are alſo many of them viſible, and ſo obvious to our ſenſes; but his eſſence is wholly, and altogether, and in all reſpects infinite, and is no way viſible or liable to apprehenſion by our ſenſes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Who dwelleth in that light that is inacceſſible.</hi> As no mortal eye
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:64652:156"/> can behold the Sun in its full ſtrength (the attempt of which, according to ſome, hath ſtruck the adventurers blind) ſo no creature whatſoever can apprehend the incomparable God in his full beauty and brightneſs, in his boundleſs excellency and perfection. It's the voice of God to <hi>Moſes, Thou canſt not ſee my face, for no man can ſee me, and live,</hi> Exod. 33.20. No man cloathed with a mortal body, or in this eſtate of imperfection, can behold an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary created appearance of God; but he is thereat filled with fears and frights, <hi>Job</hi> 4.12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Job</hi> 21.22. <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.8.16, 17. <hi>Habbak.</hi> 3.16. No man, no, nor Angel, can behold God in his infinite eſſence, to the utmoſt of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but would be thereat crumbled into nothing.</p>
               <p>Reader, if God be thus incomparably excellent, that he is excellency it ſelf, the ſtandard of all excellency, that Angels hide their heads as aſhamed of themſelves before him, that he condeſcendeth to ſhew the leaſt reſpect to his high and perfect Hoſt in Heaven, that he is infinitely above all their bleſſings and praiſes, all their conceptions, and apprehenſions; what praiſe, what
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:64652:156"/> honour, what glory ſhouldſt thou give to this God? Though thou art unable to give him all the glory that is due to his name, (yea, the thouſand thouſandth part thereof) yet do thou give him all the glory, thy mind, will, heart, affections, all thy facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties united together, and enlarged to the utmoſt, can poſſibly give him. Say to thy Soul, <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and all within me praiſe his holy name,</hi> Pſal. 103.1.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> Comfort to them that have the incomparable God for their portion.</head>
               <p>THirdly, This Doctrine may be uſeful by way of <hi>comfort</hi> to all the people of God: If God be an incomparable God, then they are incomparably bleſſed who take him for their God, who have him for their happineſs. Every perſon or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is happy, or miſerable, as the God is whom they ſerve, as that is in which they place their felicity; for nothing can give out more happineſs to another, than it hath in it ſelf. That good muſt of neceſſity be
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:64652:157"/> firſt in the cauſe, either eminently or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, which is conveyed from it to the effect. Thoſe who ſerve the fleſh as their God and chiefgood, muſt needs be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.18. Becauſe the fleſh is a baſe and vile, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. <hi>ult.</hi> a weak and impotent, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.3. a fraudulent and deceitful, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. a fading and tranſitory God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.23. So they who own, and prize, and love the world as their God and chief good (of ſuch we read, the covetous man is call'd an Idolater, and covetouſneſs Idolatry, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5.) are miſerable, becauſe their God is vain and empty, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.2, 3. piercing and vexatious, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10. uncertain and unſatisfying, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. frail, and not laſting, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. Thus they who have Idols for their Gods are miſerable, becauſe their Gods are poor pitiful, blind, deaf, and impotent Deities; <hi>They have eyes, and ſee not</hi> the wants of their worſhippers; <hi>They have ears, and hear not</hi> the ſupplications of their ſuppliants; <hi>They have hands, and work not</hi> for the relief of their Servants neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or their deliverance out of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes: and thence the Prophet infers, the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:64652:157"/> miſery of their makers and adorers; <hi>All that make them are like unto them,</hi> blind and deaf and impotent as they are, (falſhood, &amp; a lie, and vanity, and nothing, as they are, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.24.) <hi>and ſo is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that truſteth in them,</hi> Pſal. 115.5. to 9. But the perſon who through Chriſt hath an intereſt in this great God the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, all-wiſe all-ſufficient God, is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. <hi>Happy is the people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 144. ult. And incomparably happy, becauſe that God who is his portion and happineſs is an incomparable God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Scripture mentions God to be incomparable in excellency, it alſo menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons his people to be incomparable in feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and infers their incomparableneſs from his incomparableneſs who is their God.</p>
               <p>The holy Ghoſt tells us, <hi>None is like God,</hi> he hath no equal in worth and perfection. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee?</hi> Exod. 15.11. <hi>Among all the Gods there is none like to thee,</hi> Pſal. 86.6. And the holy Ghoſt tells us alſo, that no people is like the people of God, and that becauſe God is theirs. <hi>Happy art thou O Iſrael, who is like unto thee?</hi> (why whence comes their incomparable happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? truly from the incomparable God,)
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:64652:158"/> 
                  <hi>ſaved by the Lord, who is the ſhield of thine help, and the ſword of thine excellency.</hi> Again, <hi>What Nation is ſo great which hath God ſo nigh unto them,</hi> Deut. 4.7. <hi>Iſrael</hi> at this time, to fleſh and ſenſe, ſeemed a moſt unhappy people, they were in a barren and howling wilderneſs, without an houſe to hide their heads in; without food, but what a miracle ſent them in; without raiment, but what was on their backs; without any dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings or converſe with other people, nay, in the midſt of cruel and potent enemies, they muſt fight their way to <hi>Canaan</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt walled Towns, and ſturdy Giants; and yet even in this plight they are the happieſt people under the cope of heaven; Becauſe the God of heaven, the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable God, was nigh to them. <hi>David</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts Gods incomparable Majeſty, and thence <hi>Iſraels</hi> incomparable felicity, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.22, 23. <hi>Wherefore thou art great, O Lord, there is none like thee,</hi> (what followeth thence?) <hi>And what Nation at this day is like unto thy people, even like Iſrael?</hi> Reader, if thou art once effectually called, if thou art a regenerated ſanctified perſon, know to thy comfort, and rejoyce therein, that this incomparable God is thine. 2. That all his

               <p n="1">1. This incomparable God <hi>is thine.</hi> That God who hath no ſuperiour, no equal, no fellow, is thine. He that <hi>is, and there is none elſe,</hi> Iſa. 46.9. <hi>is thine.</hi> He that is that he is, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.14. is thine: Thou haſt a propriety in him, and a title to him. This is the <hi>great priviledge</hi> of heavens favourites. <hi>Behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and he will be their God,</hi> Revel. 21.3. This is the <hi>great promiſe,</hi> the ſum, the ſubſtance of all the promiſes, <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people,</hi> Jer. 31.33. This is the <hi>great prayer</hi> of all that know how to pray, or what to pray for, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.8. This is the <hi>great purchaſe of</hi> the Son of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. His name is therefore Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel, <hi>God with us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is <hi>heaven it ſelf,</hi> the very heaven of heavens; for it is not the place, but his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence which makes heaven to be heaven. <hi>In thy preſence is fulneſs of joy, and at thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore,</hi>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:64652:159"/> Pſal. 16. ult. Once more; this is the higheſt, the chiefeſt, the greateſt gift, which the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite God can give to thee. When he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth thee riches and honours and friends and relations, he can give thee greater things; when he giveth thee Sacraments and Sabbaths and ſeaſons of grace, he can give thee greater things; when he giveth thee pardon of ſin, peace of conſcience, the graces of his Spirit, he giveth thee great things, but yet he can give thee greater: but when he giveth thee himſelf, he giveth thee the greateſt gift that himſelf (though infinite in bounty) can give. O how ſweet is that term of propriety, <hi>My God, My God.</hi> The Redeemer himſelf rowl'd in his mouth over and over, as if he could never ſuck out the ſweetneſs in it, <hi>Him that overco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth will I make a pillar in the houſe of my God, and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the City of my God, which is the new Jeruſalem, which cometh down from my God,</hi> Rev. 3.12.

               <p n="2">2.
